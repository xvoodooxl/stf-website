1952. The French Union denies Corbequais requests for military assistance defending against Veronan separatists, insisting that the partially-failed Référendum sur l'Indépendance of 1949 and its controversial establishment of the Armee de Corbec meant that Paris no longer had the responsibility of coming to Corbec’s aid in resolving an “internal dispute.”

Help arrived from an unexpected source. SEAL, ARMY SF, CIA (GROUND BRANCH), M15, SAS, SBS, SASR, and a half-dozen other nations sent spies, commandos, and other covert assets to Corbec. Desperate for help, Corbec welcomed the assistance, eager to cooperate with the western strategy of “containment.” These Special Forces “advisors” created a covert task force, codenamed SPECTRE, to protect the Green Sea, and the world, from the Soviet menace.

They established a secret training facility near [Redacted], modeled after Camp Peary, VA. To the outside world, it’s unclear if SPECTRE ever existed. By 1957, a political crisis ended with the Parliamentarian appointment of King Louis Bertrand I of Corbec, but radical Jacobin terrorists assassinate the king in St. Martin just hours before his coronation. Following two weeks of savage riots, Red Army tanks roll into St. Martin under the guise of “peacekeeping,” and rename the city to Martingrad. The resulting civil war pitted Communist Verona against democratic Corbec, costing the lives of nearly one million people, ending in a fragile ceasefire in 1959 instead of a lasting peace.

For decades following its foundation, SPECTRE waged a shadow war against Soviet influence in the Green Sea and around the world. Even as funding for the program waned in the turbulent 1960’s and 1970’s, SPECTRE began finding creative ways to sure up their budget. It’s believed that when the Tanoan Cartel disappeared in 1972, the tens of millions of USD that it had hoarded in Georgetown also vanished.

When Corbec stood up the 1PH in 1963, the influence of SPECTRE was obvious. Blending technology, tactics, and a highly trained cadre of hand-picked warfighters from around the world, the 1PH focused on air-mobile cavalry tactics in order to provide region-wide rapid-response and counter-crisis deployment capabilities. Critics called it a “Corbequais Foreign Legion” and mocked its acceptance of unconventionals, retired soldiers, and expats, especially from the US and Rhodesia. Spectre along with its newfound allies fought endless silent wars for years to come.

When the situation calls for a rapid-response conventional force, 
STF relies heavily on Corbequais troops, 
relying heavily on the 1st Para-Hussars  (rumored to have been 
founded by STF operatives for this exact purpose).  When the 
mission is too sensitive for forces with such a large footprint, 
detachments of STF Gryphons are sent in to resolve the situation, 
leaving nothing but boot-prints, ruined doors, and spent shell 
casings behind.  

Fast forward to 9/11/2001, The United States is stunned with a unimaginable terror attack on U.S Soil. JSOC Task Forces and SPECIAL MISSION UNITS are created to combat existing and emerging terror groups around the world as the Global War on Terror begins.

During this time SPECTRE saw a resurgens in the middle east where it transitioned into, Spectre Task Force, a globally operating and member sourcing clandestine special operations group, is founded in 2017 and officially organized by STAR, the first Spectre Actual. This is the first time in history Spectre has been known by any and all surrounding governments.

Spectre falls back into the shadows as the years pass, Conducting business as usual, Acquiring funding from any and all sources, and making problems disappear around the globe with no questions asked. Many have asked and assumed these missions were conducted by Spectre but nothing has never been sustained.

In 2024-2025, as threats in the "Middle East and Africa" become less prominent to Western military interest, Spectre migrates to operating areas from GWOT era regions to Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, and Central Asia. Expanding into these regions means a need for more fighters and operatives to ally with, Spectre Task Force along with the absorbed 1PH Devil Birds began the search for more operatives and souls willing to make the sacrifice for global peace. Some joined for the sign-up bonuses. Others out of ideology. Others still, just wanted a fresh start. Regardless of their reasons, every candidate went through the same grueling selection process that weeded out the unfit, infirm, or uncommitted. Native-born Corbequais and foreigners fought side by side, protecting the free people of the Green Sea region, and, often enough, the rest of the world, too. Spectre Task Force continues its global fight against tyranny, even today.
