Non-verbal communications: section can be added. ✅

https://stf-website-five.vercel.app/sop/movement-tactics/individual-movement#phase-1-core-foundations
add: (skylining),standing under light sources at night (lightlining),
comment: needs clarification, skylining already in text.
add: link to Telegraphing section
comment: not needed, this is the overview page, describing what will be learned.

https://stf-website-five.vercel.app/sop/movement-tactics/individual-movement#phase-2-immediate-tactical-response
add: link to aDDD
comment: not needed, this is the overview page, describing what will be learned.

https://stf-website-five.vercel.app/sop/movement-tactics/individual-movement/cover-vs-concealment#using-smoke
add: using smoke when not needed can expose your position to the enemy as well, one must make this decision carefully. ✅

https://stf-website-five.vercel.app/sop/movement-tactics/individual-movement/non-observable-movement#route-planning
add: OAKOC: Obstacles, Avenues of Approach, Key Terrain, Observation and Fields of Fire, Cover and Concealment ✅
comment: added in leadership/frameworks section

https://stf-website-five.vercel.app/sop/movement-tactics/individual-movement/non-observable-movement#common-mistakes
add: moving on the ridge instead of slightly below the ridge on the military crest. ✅

https://stf-website-five.vercel.app/sop/movement-tactics/individual-movement/reaction-to-contact-individual#basic-reaction-sequence-rcr
remove: zig zag, that is predictable. ✅

https://stf-website-five.vercel.app/sop/movement-tactics/individual-movement/movement-techniques-individual#short-dashes-35-second-rush-concept
remove zig zag ✅

https://stf-website-five.vercel.app/sop/movement-tactics/individual-movement/observation-techniques
add: how to scan rear while moving, it was workshopped. ✅

https://stf-website-five.vercel.app/sop/movement-tactics/individual-movement/danger-areas
add: Common two types of Danger areas that we encounter are LDA, and ODA, the procedures are different, and needs to be incorporated.
The description here is good over all view, but we need more actionable direct points on how to do the crossing.
May be we make a Section level SMT Danger Area where we go into details of how to do it as a group.
comment: This need's to be added to SMT > Danger Areas Procedures, since it's a section movement. ⭕

https://stf-website-five.vercel.app/sop/movement-tactics/section-maneuvers
remove: accurate from suppressive fire. ✅
remove: hand from section Communication and control, just signals will suffice, as that can be hand, smoke, or light blinks or morse code, whatever, so general term of signal is enough. ✅
