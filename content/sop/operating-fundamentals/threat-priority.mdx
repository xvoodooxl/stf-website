# Threat Priority
*This chart lists the highest general threat priority, from top to bottom. It should be noted that these are typicalities and not law; situations may require breaking of this priority list by distance and threat level, and often. For example a combatant right in front of you with his back turned may take priority over a sniper engaging from hundreds of meters away.*
