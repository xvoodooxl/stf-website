# Suppressing Fire

> Moving without fire is suicide and fire without movement is a waste of ammunition.

Suppressing Fire is a technique that utilizes an overwhelming volume of fire to fix and temporarily incapacitate enemy forces, typically with the goal of maneuvering around said enemy. It can either be done offensively as a means of attack or defensively when retreating from contact.

### Suppressing Fire with an [Automatic Rifle](../equipment-regulations.mdx#automatic-rifleman-kit):
Suppressing Fire is done by holding the trigger for a short period of time (Think “Die Motherfucker, Die”) and then allowing a brief pause (~1 sec) before repeating. 

### Suppressing Fire with multiple weapons:
Suppressing Fire can be effectively achieved with multiple weapons by having both operators take turns sending rounds downrange (in the case of automatic riflemen, sending `bursts`); This decreases heat build, increases suppression time, and decreases downtime. When one Operator runs out of ammo (designated by “reloading”), the other will resume solo suppressing fire until the Operator has finished reloading (designated by “up” or “green”). This is also refered to as ***Talking Guns***.

### Suppressing Fire with [Standard Rifles](../equipment-regulations.mdx#rifleman-standard-kit):
While not as effective as autorifles, suppressing fire can be emulated with standard riflemen platforms by having multiple rifles place rounds in a similar target area, with a focus on paced shots for extended suppression.

***Always remember that you have limited ammunition. Suppression should be used until the depletion of one magazine or one belt, unless adviced by the team lead.***
