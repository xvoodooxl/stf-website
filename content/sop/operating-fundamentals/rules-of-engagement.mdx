# Rules of Engagement
Our Rules of Engagement (ROE) are the parameters and limitations in which we may actively engage others through any means. There are three types of on-demand ROE: **Weapons Hold**, **Weapons Tight**, and **Weapons Free**. Each of these ROE callouts may be utilized at any time by commanding elements. They may also be utilized per fireteam, as designated by the fireteam leader. Weapons Tight is always active by default.

| **Weapons Hold**        | **Weapons Tight (default)** | **Weapons Free** |

| Engaging combatants is only permitted when an imminent danger to you or your teammates (not including civilians) is present. All engagements should be immediately reported by first stating your name / sign. "*Jester dropped one close.*"        |    Engagements are allowed per fireteam leadâ€™s discretion or when an imminent threat is present to yourself, your teammates, civilians, or in keeping your presence unknown. This will typically be held during stealth / nighttime operations, and can be used to reset other modulations. If not directed to engage, engagements should be reported by stating your name.    | Engagements on all combatants at any distance are allowed, with the goal of engaging a large number of enemies at once, or to gain fire superiority in an area. Weapons Free is the most typical of open-area engagement during the day, and is used very often to break from the default ROE. |
