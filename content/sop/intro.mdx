# SPECTRE Operational Procedures (S.O.P)
This document is a collection of all policies, procedures, and tactics used by the SPECTRE Task Force, and subsequently SPECTRE Warfighters as a whole. It serves as a resource and a guide, and should be referenced when training. This document will be updated periodically until its completion.

While the tactics and methods described in this document are publicly available, the methods in which these tactics are curated and employed is specific to the SPECTRE Task Force.

## What is SPECTRE?

SPECTRE is a wargaming community with a passion for operational competence through the use of tactics drawn from real-world military doctrine. We train to execute conflict-driven, narratively connected operations with a focus on immersion and variety in scope and objective. In short, SPECTRE is a military simulation group that strives to do MORE. The community is the product of years of development, thousands of hours of collective experience between our leadership, and learning from our mistakes. Through these things, SPECTRE as a whole strives to produce a unique, immersive military simulation experience.

## What are SPECTRE core values?

SPECTRE, in an effort to cultivate a culture that inspires leaders and encourages personal growth, stands by three core pillars that you need to know:

1. **Discipline**:
All of our members strive to be skilled professionals, and are willing to put aside ego to achieve that.

2. **Brotherhood**:
Everyone in SPECTRE is a brother or sister with the rest - we all fight for each other before ALL else.

3. **Desire to Improve**:
All of us are constantly seeking to improve through self-reflection and analysis, and take pride in self-accountability.

## What commitment does SPECTRE require?
SPECTRE and its leaders all stand by the notion that LIFE COMES FIRST. Nothing here means anything if it detracts from the human experience, and we do not have explicit activity requirements for that reason. All we ask is that as a SPECTRE Warfighter, you strive to embody our core pillars, and continue to grow as a player and a person whenever possible. We believe that this creates an environment where the community experience is measured in quality in time, not quantity.

## What to expect in SPECTRE?

SPECTRE has a long-standing tradition of furthering the possibilities of its game platforms. In the case of Ground Branch, SPECTRE’s main game, many of our leaders have pioneered new methods of gameplay through utilizing the game’s systems that other communities have not. Some examples of this that we pride ourselves on are Civilian Injection (Covert Operation), HVT Operations, Indirect Fire and Close Air Support, Custom Operational Objectives, Comprehensive Overwatch (Clearing Map Boundaries), and Dynamic Operational Changes (Enemy QRF, Bomb Threats, VBIED Placement, Pilot Failures, Mortar Interception, etc.).
All of these unique possibilities created by our technically savvy members, combined with a narratively cohesive experience, creates a level of immersion and interest that lasts.
