# Room Entry And Flow

Now that the room is prepped, let's look at how entry is made. Usually the call of "entry, entry, entry" is called when entry is made so that members of the stack looking elsewhere or on security can now divert their attention to the action of entry.

### Center Fed (Strong Stack)

Center-Fed Box-shaped rooms are considered the “typicalities” of room clearing (despite there being no typicalities in CQB) because of their simplicity. The following sectors of responsibility apply to box-shaped center-fed rooms:

- **1 Man**: Enters the room by either flowing or button hooking into a room at his discretion; Checks if there is any immediate threat in the center, sends a couple of rounds if there is, then checks the hard corner on his side and works inwards.
- **2 Man**: Enters the room and moves opposite of the pointman; Checks if there is any immediate threat in the center, sends a couple of rounds if there is, then checks the hard corner on his side and works inwards.
- **3 Man**: Enters the room and moves opposite of the 2 Man; Center checks, then checks his deep corner, and works inwards.
- **4 Man**: Enters the room and moves opposite of the 3 Man; Center checks, then checks his deep corner, and works inwards.

Note: **1 Man** and **2 Man** don't have to clear the center, just deter them from shooting accurately back at the stack, and take out any threat near the door that can hose down the stack.

### Center Fed (Split Stack)

Below is the same room being cleared with a split stack instead of a strong stack. Operators should “zipper” in from the outside.

### Corner Fed (Strong Stack)

A Split stack is avoided in a corner fed room. The following sectors of responsibility apply to box-shaped corner-fed rooms:

As you can see the exact same methods are used. If there is no space on the corner side, the flow has to be adjusted such that everyone moves on the strong/long wall. For example, if 1 Man has entered a corner fed room, and faced with a wall, the 1 Man stays there if there is space for him to work, else he flows back with the rest of the team when permissible. But, at no time does he stand in the door way blocking access to the rest of the team. The 4 points of room clearning, mentioned earlier is followed.
