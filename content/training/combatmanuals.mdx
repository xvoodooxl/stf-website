# COMBAT MANUALS

## Introduction

The SPECTRE Combat Manuals provided in this document are a culmination of real-world military experience and knowledge from operators around the globe. It is the product of hundreds of hours of careful curation and application to what we do as a group. It is also constantly changing as the platforms we use to operate continue to evolve. One reading this manual may have questions or require clarification; using an appropriate channel in our discord to inquire about our doctrine and its applications is highly encouraged.

## Advisory

The SPECTRE Combat Manuals are not directly purposed for real-world use, nor does it constitute as a substantive replacement of real-world combat training. As such, SPECTRE does not condone any use of these manuals for any purpose outside of military simulation within video gaming platforms. Additionally, doctrines displayed are curated specifically for SPECTRE, and may not match what others have trained on their own, as all units have separate doctrine. As a unit with a focus on special warfare operations, it is likely that those experienced in infantry tactics and the like will find some discrepancies between these manuals and common doctrine, which is expected. We all train the same doctrine so we can all fight the same way, and Warfighters should work to learn with these tactics, not against them.
