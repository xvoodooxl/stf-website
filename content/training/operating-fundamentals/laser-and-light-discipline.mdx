# Laser and Light Discipline

## Using Visible Lights and Lasers
**Operators should only use weapon-mounted flashlights and lasers when needed**; prolonged and unnecessary use may expose a team’s position to enemies, or distract / inhibit other operators. It is highly recommended to set a “pressure keybind” on your mouse or keyboard; holding down your light keybind will activate the flashlight only for the duration of the keypress, and is highly effective for clean light discipline.

## Using IR Lights and Lasers
**IR Lights should be used the same as visible lights**, except with the understanding that they will not telegraph an operator’s position to enemies not using night-vision or other IR detecting devices. They can also be used for increased visibility with night-vision in extremely-low / zero lighting environments.

**IR Lasers should only be used under two conditions**:
- You are actively indicating an object or area of interest to a team lead or other operator.
- You are actively tracking / aiming at a target and awaiting confirmation to engage from your team lead.

*IR Lasers and IR Illuminators can be detrimental to a pointman’s ability to effectively cover his sector, if not responsibly used.*
