# 🔫 Shooting Discipline

Before you fire a shot in SPECTRE Task Force, you need to understand two things:

1. **How to handle your weapon safely**
2. **When you're actually allowed to shoot**

This guide covers both, giving you the fundamentals of responsible, effective engagement in any scenario — from stealth operations to full-contact assaults.

---

## ✅ Safety First

Weapon safety is everyone's responsibility. Violating it not only risks lives — it undermines the team.

### Golden Rules:

- Never point your weapon at a teammate — **even accidentally**
- Use **Low Ready** when near friendlies
- Always control your muzzle before moving
- Friendly fire is not “just a mistake” — it's a failure in discipline

---

## 🔻 Ready Positions

| Stance         | When to Use                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Low Ready**  | Default posture in tight or friendly-heavy areas |
| **High Ready** | Only when needed — riskier in CQB                |

> Your posture communicates intent — keep it controlled.

---

## 🧠 Earning the Shot

You don’t shoot because you want to. You shoot because:

- You have **clear Positive ID** of a hostile
- You have a **clean shot** (no friendlies or civilians in the way)
- You're **authorized** to fire — by ROE or leadership

> If it’s not safe, it’s not your shot — even if the target is hostile.

---

## 🚦 Rules of Engagement (ROE)

ROE defines **when you can shoot**. It may change based on the mission or current situation.

| ROE Level         | What It Means                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Weapons Hold**  | Only shoot if directly threatened            |
| **Weapons Tight** | Only shoot if you have PID or are ordered to |
| **Weapons Free**  | Engage any confirmed hostile freely          |

> **Default ROE is Weapons Tight** — no PID, no shot.

---

## 🕵️ Positive Identification (PID)

Before engaging a target, confirm:

- They’re armed and hostile
- Their behavior indicates threat (e.g., aiming at friendlies)
- You’ve received confirmation from leadership

**Do not shoot:**

- Unarmed contacts unless they show clear hostility
- Surrendering or captured individuals (treat as POWs)

---

## 🚨 Emergency Calls

If something goes wrong, **call it out** immediately:

- “**Negligent discharge!**” — You fired by mistake
- “**Bad frag!**” — Grenade landed dangerously
- “**Misthrow! Clear out!**” — Explosive mishandled

Own it, communicate it, reset safety.

---

## 🔼 Fire with Formation

When engaging as a team:

- Try to be **on-line** — side-by-side with teammates
- Keep **1 meter of space** between players
- If you're stacked, use **MBF: Muzzle Before Flesh**

> MBF = Your barrel must be clear of your teammate before you fire.

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- Firing without PID or ROE clearance
- Flagging teammates while moving or turning
- Not calling out safety incidents
- Shooting too early or too late due to panic

---

## ✅ Summary

- Weapon safety is your responsibility — no excuses
- Know your ROE before the mission begins
- Only fire when it's safe, legal, and tactically sound
- Use Low Ready and MBF in tight spaces
- Report mistakes immediately and professionally
