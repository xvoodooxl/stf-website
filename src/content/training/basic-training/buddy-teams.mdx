# 👥 Buddy Teams

The buddy team is the core of everything we do in SPECTRE. No one moves or fights alone — your buddy is your backup, your spotter, and your lifeline.

## 🔍 What’s a Buddy Team?

A buddy team is **2–3 players who stick together** and operate as a single tactical unit.

- **Gryphons**: 4-man team = two 2-man buddy teams
- **Devilbirds**: 6-man section = two 3-man buddy teams

Your job is to cover your buddy, move with your buddy, and survive as a team.

## 🎯 Core Responsibilities

### 🔁 Cover Each Other

- When one moves, the other covers
- Never move at the same time unless ordered

### 👁️ Shared Awareness

- Always know where your buddy is
- Watch different angles — avoid tunnel vision

### 📡 Communicate

- Speak clearly and often: “Moving,” “Set,” “Covering,” “Contact”

---

## 🚶 Moving as a Pair

Buddy teams are the basic unit for **bounding** and **fire-and-maneuver**.

### Example: Bounding

1. Buddy A says: “Moving.”
2. Buddy B replies: “Covering.”
3. Buddy A moves to new cover and says: “Set.”
4. Buddy B now moves.

> Simple, effective, and keeps you alive.

## 🧍 Formations & Spacing

You’ll often be part of a fireteam formation — wedge, column, line, etc.  
Even in formations, you operate as a buddy team.

### Spacing Rules:

- **3–5 meters** in the open
- **1–2 meters** in buildings
- **Always maintain line of sight**

> If you lose your buddy, call it out and link back up fast.

## 🏠 CQB & Tight Spaces

In close quarters:

- Use **MBF** (Muzzle Before Flesh) — your weapon clears past your buddy before you shoot
- Stack cleanly, one behind the other
- Don’t crowd corners or doors

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- ❌ Losing sight of your buddy
- ❌ Both players moving without cover
- ❌ Forgetting to call “Set!” when bounding
- ❌ Bunching up at corners or breach points

---

## ✅ Summary

- Stick together — fight as one
- Take turns moving and covering
- Communicate every step
- Watch spacing, especially in combat or tight terrain
