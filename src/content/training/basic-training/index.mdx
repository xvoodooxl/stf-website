# 🎯 Basic Training

Welcome to Basic Training — your foundation for operations in SPECTRE Task Force. Everything you learn here applies across _Arma 3_, _Arma Reforger_, and _Ground Branch_. This is where you’ll learn how to shoot safely, move smartly, and communicate clearly with your team.

We follow the principle of:

> **Shoot ➝ Move ➝ Communicate**

Each section builds on the one before it. You’re not expected to master everything at once — but completing this track will prepare you to operate effectively from day one.
