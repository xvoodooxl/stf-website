# 📡 Comms Basics

Clear communication keeps teams alive. Whether you're face-to-face or on the radio, knowing how to talk (and when not to) is just as important as knowing how to shoot.

This lesson covers how to speak clearly, use your radio properly, and stay silent when needed.

## 🗣️ Verbal Comms (Face-to-Face)

### ✅ Combat Phrases You’ll Use Often:

- **“Contact!”** – You’ve confirmed a hostile
- **“Movement!”** – Unconfirmed movement
- **“Audible!”** – Heard something (footsteps, voices)
- **“Shot!”** – You’re firing across someone’s lane — make them stop
- **“Bail! Bail! Bail!”** – Everyone break and find hard cover

Speak clearly, don’t panic, and avoid slang.

### 🔐 Verbal IFF (Challenge and Pass)

If you’re not sure someone is friendly, use the **Challenge/Pass** system:

> “**Raven?**” — “**Tac!**”

Each mission has a custom code word pair. If they get it wrong, assume they might be hostile.

## 📻 Radio Comms

We use two main radio nets:

- **Platoon Net** – For leadership coordination
- **Section Net** – For internal team comms

### Radio Format:

> “[Receiver], this is [Sender], [Message], over.”

Example:

> “Alpha, Bravo. Move to grid 0342, over.”

Use **“Over”** to pass the mic, **“Out”** to end the conversation.

### 🔁 Closed Loop Comms

Used to confirm important info:

> “Cover that window.”  
> “Covering window.”  
> “Good copy.”

Never assume your message got through — confirm it.

## 🤫 Nonverbal Comms

Sometimes you can’t talk — or you don’t want to be heard. We use **lasers, lights, and gestures**.

| Signal                 | Meaning                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| Barrel up/down         | Ready to move               |
| Laser circle           | Soft contact or signal prep |
| Solid laser            | Confirmed contact           |
| Vertical laser (       | )                           | Execute/confirm |
| Horizontal laser ( — ) | Cancel/stop                 |

Use **IR lasers** or visible lights depending on the mission.  
Brief signals before the mission if nonverbal is expected.
