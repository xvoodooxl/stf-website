# 🚶 Movement Basics

Moving smart is just as important as shooting straight. Bad movement gets you spotted, shot, or stacked on top of teammates. Good movement keeps you alive — and dangerous.

This lesson covers how to move with purpose, stay spaced, and avoid making yourself an easy target.

## 🧍 Posture and Speed

Use the right stance for the right situation.

| Posture      | Speed     | Visibility | Use When...                               |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Standing** | Fast      | High       | You’re not in contact and speed is needed |
| **Crouched** | Moderate  | Medium     | You want to stay low and quiet            |
| **Prone**    | Very Slow | Very Low   | You’re under threat or sneaking           |

> Lower posture = harder to see or hit. But it’s slower — balance is key.

## ⏱️ Short Dashes

Move in **3–5 second sprints** between cover:

- Plan your next move before you go
- Sprint, stop, and scan
- Avoid straight lines — zig or change speed under fire

> Never run just to run. Move with a destination and purpose.

## 🧠 Spacing = Survival

Too close? One grenade can kill two people.  
Too far? You can’t support each other.

| Environment     | Ideal Spacing |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| Open Terrain    | 7–10 meters   |
| Forests / Urban | 3–5 meters    |
| Indoors / CQB   | 1–2 meters    |

**Key habit:** Always check the distance to the person ahead of you — you’re responsible for it.

## 🌲 Movement in Terrain

### Open Ground

- Move fast, stay low
- Use prone or crouched if you’re under observation
- Use smoke if there’s no natural cover

### Forest / Vegetation

- Move slowly to avoid noise
- Use trees and bushes to break line of sight

### Urban / Buildings

- Hug walls and corners
- Watch your angles — don’t block buddy lanes
- Avoid bunching at doorways or windows
