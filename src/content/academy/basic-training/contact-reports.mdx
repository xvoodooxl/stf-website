# 📣 Contact Reports

When you see the enemy, **how** you report it matters. Clear, fast contact calls help your team react, orient, and win the fight.

This lesson teaches two key formats:

- **aDDD** — fast and simple (default)
- **ADDRAC** — more detailed (used by leaders)

---

## ⚡ aDDD – Fast Contact Call

Used by everyone, especially under fire.  
**aDDD** stands for:

> **Alert, Direction, Distance, Description**

### Example:

> “Contact! North! 30 meters! Two armed!”

### Breakdown:

- **Alert**: Get attention — “Contact!”
- **Direction**: Where the enemy is — cardinal or relative (“North”, “Left”, “12 o'clock”)
- **Distance**: Rough estimate in meters
- **Description**: What you see — “Two armed”, “Vehicle”, “Patrol”, etc.

> This is your default contact report. Use it any time you spot hostiles or get engaged.

## 🎯 ADDRAC – Detailed Report (Leaders Only)

Used by team or section leaders when there’s time to plan a coordinated response.

> **Alert, Direction, Description, Range, Assignment, Control**

### Example:

> “Contact, South, 3-man patrol, 50 meters, Red team flank right, hold until I fire.”

### Breakdown:

- **Alert** – “Contact!”
- **Direction** – Enemy location
- **Description** – Who or what you see
- **Range** – Estimated distance
- **Assignment** – Who is doing what (“Red team flank”)
- **Control** – When to act (“Hold until I fire”)

> ADDRAC gives orders while reporting. It’s for structured movement, not snap reactions.

## 📦 Optional: What’s an ACE Report?

You may hear leaders call for an **ACE Report** after a fight.

**ACE = Ammo, Casualties, Equipment**

Reports use colors:

- 🟢 Green – Fully effective
- 🟡 Yellow – Minor issues
- 🔴 Red – Limited capability
- ⚫ Black – Combat ineffective

As a new player, **you don’t need to give ACE** unless asked. Just tell your lead if you’re low on ammo, hurt, or missing gear.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- ❌ Forgetting direction or distance
- ❌ Giving vague calls like “Over there!”
- ❌ Not calling out contact at all
- ❌ Talking too long under fire
- ❌ Confusing ADDRAC with aDDD

---

## ✅ Summary

- Use **aDDD** for fast, clear contact calls
- Use **ADDRAC** only if you're giving orders as a leader
- Don’t stay silent — call it out!
- Keep it short, calm, and useful
