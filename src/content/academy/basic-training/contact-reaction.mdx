# 🚨 Contact Reaction

Getting shot at is one of the most stressful moments in a mission — and also one of the most dangerous if you freeze or panic.

This lesson teaches you how to respond instinctively and effectively using our **RCR** method:

> **Return Fire ➝ Cover ➝ Return Accurate Fire**

---

## 🧱 RCR: The SPECTRE Standard

### 1. 🔥 Return Fire

Shoot back immediately — even if you're unsure exactly where the shots are coming from. The goal is to:

- Disrupt the enemy’s aim
- Regain the initiative
- Buy yourself time to move

> Suppression is survival — your first rounds don’t need to hit, they just need to make the enemy duck.

---

### 2. 🧱 Cover

Once you’ve fired, **move to the nearest solid cover**:

- Use trees, walls, rocks, or anything that blocks bullets
- If no cover is nearby, use concealment to break line of sight
- Move unpredictably (zigzag, change speed)

> Don’t stand and shoot — if you’re in the open, you're exposed.

---

### 3. 🎯 Return Accurate Fire

From behind cover:

- Locate the threat (visually or by movement/sound)
- Fire controlled, aimed shots
- Stay low and only expose as needed

> Now is the time to neutralize the threat — not before.

---

## 📡 Reporting the Contact

Once you’re in cover, let your team know using the **aDDD** format:

> **Alert, Direction, Distance, Description**

**Example:**

> “Contact! North, 40 meters, two armed!”

This tells your team:

- There’s a threat
- Where it is
- How far
- What kind

---

## 🧠 Follow-Up Actions

After your initial RCR and report:

- Stay alert — threats can shift
- Be ready to move again, flank, suppress, or follow orders
- Watch for teammate actions and coordinate with your buddy

> You're not done until the threat is neutralized or your team leader gives new orders.

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- ❌ Freezing when taking fire
- ❌ Skipping return fire — giving the enemy freedom to aim
- ❌ Not moving to cover fast enough
- ❌ Trying to ID the target before suppressing
- ❌ Forgetting to report the contact

---

## ✅ Summary

When you're under fire:

1. **Shoot back** — suppress immediately
2. **Get to cover** — protect yourself
3. **Return accurate fire** — now you fight properly
4. **Report the threat** — use aDDD to keep your team in the loop

> React fast. Move smart. Communicate clearly.
