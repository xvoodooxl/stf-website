# 🧱 Cover & Concealment

If you want to survive in combat, you need to understand the difference between **cover** and **concealment** — and how to use both.

This lesson will teach you how to fight smarter, move safer, and make yourself harder to hit.

---

## 🧱 What Is Cover?

**Cover** = Something that physically blocks bullets.  
Examples:

- Walls
- Trees
- Vehicles
- Sandbags

**Use cover to:**

- Break enemy line of fire
- Stabilize your position for return fire
- Reload, heal, or observe safely

---

## 🫥 What Is Concealment?

**Concealment** = Something that hides you but doesn’t stop bullets.  
Examples:

- Bushes
- Foliage
- Shadows
- Smoke

**Use concealment to:**

- Move without being seen
- Break visual contact
- Set up an ambush or cross terrain stealthily

---

## 🧠 How to Use Cover Effectively

- **Peek smart** — expose only your head and weapon
- **Shoot from the sides**, not over the top
- **Use angles** to minimize exposure
- **Don’t crowd** — one person per cover spot

> Being behind cover doesn’t mean you're safe — how you use it matters.

---

## 🎯 Fighting from Cover

- Use **Return Fire ➝ Cover ➝ Return Accurate Fire (RCR)** when reacting to contact
- **Don’t stay static** — reposition after a few shots if possible
- **Stay low** — crouch or go prone to limit your profile

---

## 💨 Using Smoke

When there’s no natural cover or concealment:

- **Deploy smoke** to break enemy line of sight
- Throw **between you and the enemy**, not on top of yourself
- Use smoke to:
  - Cross open ground
  - Break contact
  - Conceal a casualty or reload

> Not all games have the same smoke behavior — test it in training missions.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- ❌ Using bushes as if they were cover
- ❌ Standing fully exposed behind low walls
- ❌ Bunching up behind the same object
- ❌ Ignoring movement options while behind cover
- ❌ Tossing smoke directly on yourself

---

## ✅ Summary

- **Cover** stops bullets — use it when under fire
- **Concealment** hides you — use it when moving or sneaking
- Fight from cover smartly: expose less, move often
- Smoke is a tool, not a shield — place it wisely
