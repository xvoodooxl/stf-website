# 🪖 Introduction to Roles

Every member of SPECTRE Task Force takes on a **combat role** during operations. Your role determines your responsibilities in the team — but it doesn’t define your status or rank. Roles are tools we use to stay organized and effective.

This guide introduces the core roles you might be assigned, so you know what to expect and how to contribute.

## 🔧 How Roles Work

- Roles are assigned by your **team leader** based on mission needs.
- You should be ready to switch roles as needed — flexibility is key.
- All roles are used in both small and large teams across all our games.

Whether you’re part of a 4-man fireteam (_Gryphons_) or a 6-man section (_Devilbirds_), the same core ideas apply.

## 🧍 Core Combat Roles

These are the most common roles. You’ll usually start as one of these:

| Role                    | What You Do                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rifleman**            | Your go-to role. Standard rifle, all-around capable.                      |
| **AT Rifleman (Light)** | Carries a light anti-tank launcher. Great against vehicles, stays mobile. |
| **AT Rifleman (Heavy)** | Heavy launcher for big targets. Slower to move, but powerful.             |
| **AutoRifleman**        | Lays down suppressive fire. Helps cover movement and anchors positions.   |
| **Designated Marksman** | Provides accurate mid-range fire. Supports overwatch and recon.           |

## 🛠️ Special Roles

These are used for specific mission types or objectives. You’ll be briefed if you’re assigned one:

| Role                        | What You Do                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sapper**                  | Handles breaching, demolitions, and objective denial.             |
| **Combat Medic**            | Keeps teammates alive and moving. Provides field medical support. |
| **Intel Operator**          | Helps gather information and improve team awareness.              |
| **JTAC / Forward Observer** | Coordinates artillery or airstrikes. Calls in fire support.       |

## 🎯 What to Focus On as a New Player

Start by mastering the **Rifleman** role. It’s the foundation for everything else:

- Learn to move with your team
- Use cover and concealment
- Communicate clearly
- React to threats effectively

Once you’re confident, you can try other roles depending on mission needs.

## 🗨️ Final Tip

> You’re not locked into any role. Be adaptable, pay attention, and support your team.

Your attitude and teamwork matter more than your gear. Get good at the basics, and the rest will follow.
