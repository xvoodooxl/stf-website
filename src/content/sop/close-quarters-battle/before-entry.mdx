# Before Entry | Stacks
Before entry into a room we need to get ready to enter a room. This is done by "stacking up" outside the door. There are 3 possibilities of how we can stack up on a door. 
Stacking for entry is very important, we want to make entry in a fast and organized way, for it to be effective.

| **Strong Stack** : The entire stack is set on one side of a threshold / doorway. | **Split Stack**: The entire stack is split evenly between both sides of a threshold. | **Uneven Stack**:  The entire stack is split unevenly between both sides of a threshold. (*happens after deliberate*)|
