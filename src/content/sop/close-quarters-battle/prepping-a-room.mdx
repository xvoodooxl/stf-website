# Prepping a Room

Before entry into a room/threshold one or more of the following is done to prepare the room.

- Flash bang the entrance area
- Grenade into the room if we know for sure who is inside, and we don't want them to live. (_This is covered in Advanced CQB Training_)
- A breaching charge on the door to facilitate a violent/surprise entry. Usually done of the first door we enter, or on doors where stacking is not practical. Team lead will call for a breaching charge when needed. (_This is covered in Advanced CQB Training_)

## Flashbang | Frag Procedure

The most common way to prepare a room for entry is the use of a flashbang. The following procedure is used for various reasons, primarily the limitation in game.

1. Point man or Team Leader will ask for a flashbang, either verbally or non verbally (taught in CQB trainings).
2. Point man will step out from the wall and slightly into the threshold to allow a good angle for two man. He will not move from this position until the flashbang is in the room.
3. Two man will take out a flashbang and take position behind the point man. The point man and his plates (armor) protect the two man.
4. Two man will set his arc using the mouse wheel.
5. When two man has his arc set and is ready, he will call `flash ready` to the point man.
6. Point man will respond with `swinging` and open the door.
7. Two man throws the flashbang.
8. Both point man and two man step back to the wall where they were before away from the threshold and back into cover.
9. As soon as the flashbang goes off, entry is made.

The same procedure can be used if a Grenade (Frag) is called for by the team lead into a room, with the only difference being the two man will call `frag ready` and as the frag goes out, he will call `frag out`.

## Breaching Charge Procedure

When called for, the **3 Man** is responsible for planting a breaching charge, as a breaching charge is usually used in conjunction with a flash bang, which is the responsibility of the **2 Man**. The procedure for a breaching charge is as follows:

1. Point man or Team Leader will call for a breaching change either verbally or nonverbally (view nonverbals).
2. Three man will call `breacher up` and approach the door with his rifle out.
3. Three man will set the charge on the door and get his sidearm out.
4. Three man returns to his place in the stack.
5. Team Lead will give control to the breacher with the call `breacher you have control`
6. If a flash was called in conjuction with the breaching change it will be prepped with the same procedure we saw before.
7. Breacher will call `i have control`.
8. Breacher will call `breaching, breaching, breaching` and activate the charge.
9. If a flash was call for it will go into the room.
10. Entry is made.
