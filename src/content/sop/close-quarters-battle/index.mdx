# CLOSE QUARTERS BATTLE (CQB)

_“CQB Methodology is the pinnacle of a deadly unit’s abilities. It represents the nastiest, cruelest man-to-man combat war has to offer. While it is never a sound idea to move into an area with enemies, traps, complex layouts, and essentially no cover, we don’t always have the liberty of avoiding CQB. It is imperative that we train constantly to increase our odds at survival in these environments. Train and master it, and you will forever be a force to be reckoned with in the field.“_ -Star

Despite the obvious convention, these are ordered with FOUNDATION in mind. These are listed with clearing FIRST, and entry SECOND. That is because entry gives space and time, whereas clearing does not.

## Fundamental Rules of Room Clearing

Room clearing can be a challenging and intense process, and these rules exist to alleviate some of that pressure, we have a simple acronym to remember them by, **`R.O.W.W`**:

- **R - Run**: Do NOT sit in or walk through doorways. Always jog through them and get out of the fatal funnel.
- **O - Opposite**: Always try to do the opposite of the person in front of you. If the man in front of you goes into a room and turns left, you go in and turn right.
- **W - Work**: Do not sit still, continue to move and look for work. The longer you are static, the longer the area around you will develop.
- **W - Walls**: Move along walls where possible, don’t step into the center of a room.

Now that we have memorized these rules we can look at the details of indoor CQB.
