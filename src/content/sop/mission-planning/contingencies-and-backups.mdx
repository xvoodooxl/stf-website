# Contingency Planning

No plan survives contact. That’s not a cliché — it’s a truth that SPECTRE leaders prepare for.

Contingency planning isn’t about pessimism. It’s about ensuring that when the unexpected happens, your team knows what to do, who to follow, and where to go next.

## 🎯 Why Plan for Failure?

- Reduces **decision paralysis** in crisis
- Enables **decentralized execution**
- Increases **confidence under stress**
- Prevents total breakdown when leadership is lost

---

## 🔁 Core Contingency Types

### 1. Route Failure

- Primary route is blocked, covered, or exposed
- Switch to **Alternate Route (e.g., Route BLUE)**
- Define fallback rally point or concealed bypass

---

### 2. Leadership Loss

- Team Lead is incapacitated or disconnected
- Define a **clear 2IC (Second in Command)** beforehand
- Ensure everyone knows chain of succession

> Good teams train to lead from within — not wait for orders.

---

### 3. Comms Failure

- Radios are lost, jammed, or broken
- Use pre-briefed **time triggers** or **visual cues**
- Mark fallback comms points or sync lines

> See: [Timing & Synchronization](./timing-and-sync)

---

### 4. Mission Change

- Unexpected enemy presence or change in ROE
- Define **abort criteria**, **hold conditions**, or **mission priority hierarchy**
- Build phase transitions into the OPORD: “If OBJ Alpha fails, hold Bravo, reassess.”

---

### 5. Sustainment Disruption

- Supply drop fails, CASEVAC unavailable
- Plan for **emergency redistribution** or fallback position
- Prepare to **continue the fight with degraded capacity**

---

## 🛠️ Best Practices

### Predefine Triggers

- “If comms go dark for 2 min, regroup at Rally Point Charlie”
- “If contact at breach is too heavy, break and fallback 50m”

### Use Simple Language

Contingency orders must be **easy to remember** and **brief under stress**:

- “Bravo breaks left, Alpha suppresses”
- “Blue smokes mean fallback”

### Build In Decision Points

Add pauses to reassess:

- After reaching phase lines
- After contact
- After team separation

---

## 💡 In-Game Considerations

- Practice comms blackouts and team-lead casualties during drills
- Run missions with no backup comms to test fallback protocols
- Use simple rally symbols (e.g., smoke, lights, voice) where needed

---

## Final Tip

A flexible plan isn't one that changes constantly — it's one that **knows when and how to change**.
