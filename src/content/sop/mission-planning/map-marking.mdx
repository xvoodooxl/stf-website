# Map Marking & Terrain Use

Clear map markings are essential to synchronized operations. Whether in pre-mission planning or live execution, good markings help units move safely, cover one another, and avoid confusion in high-stress environments.

This guide provides **platform-agnostic principles** for effective map marking, usable across tactical simulation games.

## 🎯 Purpose of Marking

Markings help teams:

- **Visualize intent** before stepping off
- **Coordinate movement** between teams or elements
- **Reduce radio traffic** with shared visual references
- **Avoid friendly fire** or crossing lines of fire
- **Build shared mental models** of the battlefield

---

## ✅ Marking Best Practices

### 1. Keep It Minimal

Only mark what’s necessary for mission success:

- Routes
- Objectives
- Rally or hold points
- Breach or overwatch positions
- Known or suspected enemy locations

Too much clutter **reduces clarity**.

---

### 2. Prioritize Readability

Use **short labels**, consistent color coding, and clear icons or shapes. Avoid inside jokes, unnecessary naming, or visual noise.

- Names should be **functional** ("Hold 1", "Overwatch Alpha", "Route Red")
- Use **uppercase** for clarity where possible

---

### 3. Use Consistent Categories

Markings typically fall into these types:

| Category        | Description                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Movement**    | Routes, phase lines, dismount points |
| **Engagement**  | Fire lines, breach points, TRPs      |
| **Command**     | Rally points, command posts, LZs     |
| **Enemy Intel** | Suspected or known enemy positions   |
| **Support**     | CASEVAC zones, resupply, overwatch   |

---

### 4. Align Markings to Terrain

Markings should reference **natural terrain features**:

- Rivers, ridgelines, forests, walls, buildings, road intersections
- Avoid abstract “floating” icons or grids with no visual anchor
- Use **line-of-sight logic** — overwatch should actually be able to see

---

### 5. Use Directional Arrows for Routes

Show **direction of travel** with arrows or tick marks. This prevents misinterpretation during multi-element moves.

---

### 6. Label Key Points Sequentially

Use logical naming for flow:

> Example:
>
> - PHASE LINE RED
> - PHASE LINE BLUE
> - OBJ ALPHA
> - OBJ BRAVO

Keep naming intuitive — especially for missions involving multiple teams or dynamic movement.

---

### 7. Confirm Shared Understanding

Before stepping off, all element leads should:

- Review the map
- Confirm routes and hold points
- Clarify any **ambiguous or unclear markings**

Live coordination should build **on** the map plan — not replace it entirely.

---

## ⚠️ Notes on Platform Differences

SPECTRE operates across multiple games with different tools:

- Some platforms support persistent map layers
- Others use temporary markers, pings, or shared whiteboards

**Work within the limits of your platform**, but apply the same logic: clarity, coordination, and discipline in how the map is used.

---

## Final Reminder

Your map is not just a planning tool — it's a **shared language** between teams. Treat it like comms: clean, deliberate, and mission-focused.
