# Route Planning & Evaluation

Movement is where most missions succeed — or fail. A well-planned route can help your team avoid contact, exploit terrain, and arrive at the objective intact. A poorly planned one leads to exposure, disorientation, or fratricide.

This guide outlines how SPECTRE units plan routes across all operational platforms.

---

## 🎯 Route Planning Objectives

A good route:

- **Controls exposure** to threats
- **Provides options** for adapting under fire
- **Supports timing** and synchronization with other elements
- **Leverages terrain** to enhance stealth or overwatch
- **Enables fallback or CASEVAC** if needed

---

## ✅ Planning Best Practices

### 1. Use Terrain to Your Advantage

- Move **behind ridgelines**, through woods, or in dead ground
- **Avoid skylining** on hills or walking across open fields
- Pick routes that **offer concealment or cover**, even if they’re slower

> Rule of thumb: _If you can see them, they can see you — unless you're better hidden._

---

### 2. Create Decision Points

Mark key **decision points** along your route where you might:

- Shift to a backup route
- Initiate an assault or breach
- Hold for synchronization
- Divert due to unexpected enemy presence

Don't treat routes as single paths — treat them as **branching options**.

---

### 3. Include Rally & Hold Points

If your route spans a long distance or multiple phases:

- Designate **Rally Points** to regroup if teams become separated
- Use **Hold Points** to sync timing before final movement
- These are especially useful when working across terrain that breaks line of sight

---

### 4. Define Movement Timing

Time-based coordination is key for multi-element ops:

- **Start times**, **phase lines**, and **check-in times** help sync movement
- Avoid bottlenecks by staggering movement where terrain is restrictive

---

### 5. Build a Backup Plan

Route planning should always include:

- **Primary Route (Route RED)**
- **Alternate Route (Route BLUE)**
- **Abort Plan** — where to fall back, and under what conditions

Always brief your team on what to do **if the route fails**.

---

### 6. Avoid Route Telegraphing

Don’t make your route obvious to the enemy:

- Avoid cutting direct lines toward objectives
- Don’t follow roads unless necessary
- Vary approach angles and entry directions when possible

---

### 7. Keep It Visual

Routes should be marked clearly for all teams:

- Arrows for direction
- Labels for rally points, phase lines, and waypoints
- Match naming with verbal brief

> See also: [Map Marking & Terrain Use](./map-marking)

---

## 🚨 In-Game Considerations

Depending on the platform (Arma, Ground Branch, Reforger):

- Some tools allow persistent map lines
- Others rely on radio + shared visual terrain
- Use local pings, hand signals, or briefed landmarks as fallback methods

---

## Final Tip

Don’t assume you’ll follow the plan exactly. **Build routes that can flex**. It’s better to change a good plan under fire than to cling to a bad one.
