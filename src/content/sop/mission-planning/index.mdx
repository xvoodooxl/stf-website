# Mission Planning

Planning is the bridge between mission context and tactical execution.

In SPECTRE, planning does **not** mean dictating how every team should move. Instead, it means giving Warfighters the tools to understand the mission, assess the environment, and create their own plans ‚Äî clearly, collaboratively, and in line with shared doctrine.

> ‚ÄúThe plan is a compass, not a cage.‚Äù
