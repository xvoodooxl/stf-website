# OPERATIONS ORDER (OPORD)

> This OPORD format provides mission-critical context and tasking without prescribing execution. It is intended to give players the **why**, **what**, and **with what** — and let them determine the **how**.

---

## Operation Name:

**[Codename]**

## Date:

**[DD MMM YYYY]**

## Unit:

**[e.g., Devilbirds / Gryphons / Joint Task Force]**

## Briefed By:

**[Name or Callsign of PL/SL/GM]**

---

## 1. BACKGROUND

What is the larger strategic or narrative context behind this mission?

- What’s going on in the world/region?
- Why is this theater of operations important?
- What has led up to this deployment?

---

## 2. SITUATION

What is the immediate tactical or political situation prompting this mission?

- Who controls the AO?
- What recent events or enemy actions triggered the operation?
- What time pressure or constraints exist?

---

## 3. MISSION

What is the overall purpose of this operation?

> _Example: "SPECTRE units are to secure and hold COMPOUND FALCON to disrupt enemy resupply routes and enable further coalition push into the northern corridor."_

Keep this **one to two sentences** max — it’s the “elevator pitch” of the op.

---

## 4. ENEMY FORCES

Provide a realistic threat picture. Be vague or precise depending on intel quality.

- Composition (infantry, armor, SF, militia, IED threat)
- Strength (e.g., reinforced platoon, mechanized squad)
- Known or suspected locations
- Morale, posture (defensive, aggressive, static)
- Intel reliability (e.g., “SIGINT unreliable,” “CIVINT mixed,” “confirmed drone visuals”)

---

## 5. FRIENDLY FORCES

Outline allied assets and available support.

- Primary units (e.g., 1x SPECTRE Section, JTAC)
- Attachments (e.g., drone, recon element, mortar team)
- Support assets (e.g., rotary, CAS, convoy vehicles)
- External allies in AO (if any)

---

## 6. TASKS

List clear, **sequential or parallel objectives**. These will form the skeleton of the operation.

1. [Initial objective — e.g., "Recon approach route and establish overwatch"]
2. [Main task — e.g., "Secure and clear COMPOUND FALCON"]
3. [Follow-up task — e.g., "Establish defensive perimeter until extraction"]

> These tasks should **not prescribe exact movement or formations** — just goals.

## 7. ADMIN NOTES (Optional)

You may include helpful notes here for whoever is receiving the OPORD:

- Time of live brief
- Known mods or server changes
- Environmental factors (nighttime, fog, comms blackout)
