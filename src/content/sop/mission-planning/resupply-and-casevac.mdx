# Resupply & CASEVAC Planning

Good units plan for success. Great units plan for problems. Resupply and CASEVAC (Casualty Evacuation) are not afterthoughts — they are part of the mission.

This guide outlines how SPECTRE teams incorporate sustainment and medical contingencies into tactical planning, regardless of game platform.

---

## 🎯 Why It Matters

- **No ammo, no fight.**
- **No medevac, no recovery.**
- **No plan, no survivability.**

Planning these components increases mission endurance and minimizes downtime, especially during prolonged engagements or multi-phase operations.

## 🔧 Resupply Planning

### 1. Estimate Ammo and Equipment Needs

Before stepping off:

- Know what each element is carrying (ammo, AT, demo, medical)
- Plan for worst-case usage based on task and enemy type
- Rehearse internal ammo sharing if supply is limited

---

### 2. Designate a Resupply Method

Your plan should include:

- **Resupply Trigger** – E.g., “after objective clear” or “50% ammo status”
- **Resupply Location** – Pre-designated point or mobile cache
- **Resupply Source** – Logistics team, support unit, dropped cache, fallback base

Brief **how** resupply will be handled — don’t assume someone else will bring it.

---

### 3. Include Redundancies

- Carry partial spares across teams (e.g., each fireteam with 1x AT round, even if not assigned)
- Consider cached supplies en route if extended movement is expected

---

## 🩹 CASEVAC Planning

### 1. Define Roles and Priorities

- **Who handles initial aid?** (Medic or designated Rifleman)
- **Who carries injured?** (If platform allows — otherwise, who covers?)
- **What is the triage protocol?** Stabilize and hold, or move and patch?

Even without game mechanics, decide on **protocol** for handling wounded.

---

### 2. Set CASEVAC Conditions

- At what point do you pull back an injured Warfighter?
- Where is the **Collection Point** or **fallback zone**?
- Is there a QRF or support asset available for evacuation?

Make these decisions _before_ contact, not during.

---

### 3. Coordinate with Support Elements

If available:

- JTAC / Platoon Lead should know if CASEVAC is limited or delayed
- Ensure that **all elements know the medical handoff chain**

If no medical assets exist, plan for **self-extraction and regroup**.

## 🧠 Planning Considerations

| Factor         | Think About...                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Duration       | Multi-phase ops need pre-staged supplies    |
| Terrain        | CASEVAC routes must be passable & covered   |
| Threat Level   | Avoid static resupply in high-contact zones |
| Team Structure | Who's carrying the med gear or spare ammo?  |

---

## ⚠️ Platform-Agnostic Advice

- If no physical resupply system exists, use **“soft limits”** — teams report low ammo and simulate running dry
- If medevac isn’t possible, simulate **extraction delays**, **penalties**, or **combat loss consequences**
- Use designated areas (vehicles, crates, backpacks) as **roleplayed caches or CASEVAC hubs**

---

## Final Tip

Every mission has a failure point — planning for sustainment makes sure that point **isn’t you**.
