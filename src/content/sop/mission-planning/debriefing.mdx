# After Action Review (AAR)

The mission isn't over when the last shot is fired — it’s over when the team learns from it.

A debrief is not just a recap. It’s a structured opportunity to reinforce what went well, correct what didn’t, and prepare the unit to be better next time.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Debrief

- Reinforce **positive behaviors**
- Address **friction points or mistakes**
- Surface **confusion or breakdowns**
- Encourage **constructive communication**
- Solidify **doctrine and expectations**

---

## 📋 Basic Debrief Format

1. **Overview from Lead**

   - What happened, what was expected, what changed
   - Highlight major decisions and their results

2. **Team Lead Feedback**

   - Each element provides a short summary of their experience and performance

3. **Open Floor**

   - Controlled time for all Warfighters to share feedback, issues, or callouts

4. **Corrections & Praise**

   - Address key teaching points
   - Acknowledge standout performance

5. **Doctrine Reinforcement**
   - Revisit relevant SOPs or tactical points if confusion emerged
   - Suggest drills or focus areas for training

> “Praise in public, correct with purpose.”

## ✅ Best Practices

- **Keep it focused.** Don’t relive the entire op — hit the high-impact points
- **Avoid blame.** Frame everything around the mission, not the individual
- **Encourage honesty.** Even leads make mistakes — set the tone
- **Respect silence.** If a player didn’t speak, ask — but don’t force

---

## 🧠 Feedback Style

Use this model for clear, actionable feedback:

- **What worked:** “Team 2 held great spacing under fire.”
- **What didn’t:** “Our route ran too close to open terrain, and we were skylined.”
- **Why it matters:** “This exposed us to crossfire from the orchard.”
- **How to improve:** “Next time, shift route east into the treeline.”

---

## ⏱️ Timing the Debrief

- **Keep it short.** 5–10 minutes is ideal
- **Hold attention.** Delay post-op chatter until the debrief ends
- **Use structure.** Don’t go element-by-element unless it’s a short mission

> Debriefs are part of the mission — not an optional extra.

---

## ⚠️ In-Game Considerations

- Use shared voice, text channels, or physical gathering areas
- If attention fades quickly, prioritize the top 2–3 lessons
- Post written summaries if necessary

---

## Final Tip

Treat every op like a rehearsal for the next one. The debrief is where it becomes more than just gameplay.

> “A mission without a debrief is just noise. Turn it into music.”
