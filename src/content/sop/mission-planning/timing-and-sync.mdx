# Timing & Synchronization

Synchronization is what separates a plan from a series of disconnected actions. Whether clearing a compound, initiating a breach, or withdrawing under fire — timing is what holds it all together.

This document provides best practices for synchronizing actions across multiple elements, regardless of what platform or tools you're using.

---

## 🎯 Why Synchronization Matters

- Ensures **mutual support** between elements
- Maximizes the impact of **shock actions**
- Prevents **fratricide** and overlapping fields of fire
- Helps **compensate for comms limitations** during chaos

---

## 🔧 Core Concepts

### 1. Phase-Based Planning

Break operations into named phases with clear triggers:

- **Phase RED** – Infiltration to staging
- **Phase BLUE** – Breach and clear
- **Phase GREEN** – Exfiltration

Each element knows what phase they’re in and what marks the transition.

---

### 2. Triggers & Synchronization Cues

You don’t need synchronized watches — just synchronized cues.

Examples of phase triggers:

- “On gunfire” — e.g., "Second team opens fire once breach is made"
- “On callout” — verbal signal from another element
- “On radio code” — prearranged word or phrase (e.g., "Jackal Green")
- “On clock time” — agreed timestamp (server clock or estimated)
- “On visual” — flare, flashbang, smoke, movement

Keep triggers **simple, repeatable, and pre-briefed**.

---

### 3. Timing Deliberate Movement

When multiple teams are maneuvering:

- Use **time buffers** between actions
- Account for **slowest element**
- Assign **hold points** to allow for regrouping
- Expect delays — build time margins into plans

---

### 4. Simultaneity in Assault

For maximum shock effect:

- Time assaults to hit multiple sides **within 5–10 seconds**
- Confirm visual or audible cues before moving
- If in doubt — hold and call sync rather than rush out of step

> Simultaneous does **not** mean identical — it means _converging with purpose_.

## 🧠 Tactical Use Cases

| Task              | Sync Tactic                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Breach + Cover    | Visual cue from overwatch (e.g., “greenlight”) |
| Diversion + Entry | Countdown or reaction to stimulus              |
| Staggered advance | Hold at waypoints until cleared                |
| Coordinated exfil | Confirm all units staged before movement       |

---

## ⚠️ Platform-Agnostic Advice

- In low-tool environments (e.g., no radios or markers), **designate roles with visual spacing** and hand signals
- In high-chaos missions, use **pre-briefed fallback sync points** (e.g., “Phase Bravo starts no later than 5 mins in”)

---

## Final Tip

A good plan executed together is stronger than a perfect plan executed alone.
