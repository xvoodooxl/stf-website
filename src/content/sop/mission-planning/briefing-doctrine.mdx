# Briefing Doctrine

Briefings are how we frame the mission, establish shared understanding, and set conditions for success — **without dictating execution**. In SPECTRE, the planning burden doesn’t fall on one leader alone. Instead, we empower each element to contribute to the plan and adapt in the field.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

SPECTRE briefings aim to:

- Establish **context** (what’s happening and why)
- Deliver **intent** (what must be achieved)
- Provide **structure** (when, where, who is involved)
- Enable **team-driven planning**

A good briefing doesn’t prescribe how your team will move — it gives them the tools to figure that out.

---

## 📋 Standard Format (Simplified OPORD)

Briefings follow this structure:

1. **Situation** – What’s happening and why it matters
2. **Mission** – Clear one-sentence statement of the objective
3. **Tasks** – What must be accomplished (not how)
4. **Sustainment** – Resupply, CASEVAC, logistics notes
5. **Command & Signal** – Callsigns, channels, key comms info

> See: [OPORD Template](./opord-template)

---

## 📢 Delivery Expectations

Briefings should be:

- **Delivered verbally** by the designated operation lead (PL, SL, GM, etc.)
- **Accompanied by a marked map** using consistent symbols
- **Posted as an OPORD** when possible for written reference
- **Followed by Q&A**, where subordinate leads can clarify before making their own plans

## 🕒 Briefing Timeline

| Format            | When                       | Purpose                               |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **WARNO**         | 12–24 hours before mission | Early alert, allows prep              |
| **OPORD**         | ~1 hour before step-off    | Provides full mission context         |
| **Live Briefing** | 10–15 minutes pre-op       | Verbal summary and map visual         |
| **Team Planning** | Immediately after brief    | Leaders develop their execution plans |

## 🗺️ Visual Aids & Markers

Use standardized symbols and color codes:

- **Red** – Enemy forces / threats
- **Blue** – Friendly units / routes
- **Green** – Objectives / rally points
- **Yellow** – Infrastructure or support
- **Icons** – Breach, TRP, overwatch, LZs, etc.

## 👂 Player Expectations

All members are expected to:

- Remain silent during briefs unless prompted
- Take notes or mark maps if needed
- Ask clarifying questions during Q&A
- Repeat back their assigned task when requested

> Example: “Copy. Task is to breach Bravo by 0030 and hold for 10 minutes.”

---

## 🔁 In-Mission Refreshers

Team Leads should:

- Give short 10–15 second recaps before stepping off
- Reconfirm ROE, timing, and contingencies
- Pass on any updates from Command

---

## 🔧 Optional Enhancements

Enhance immersion and clarity with:

- Operation codenames and theme
- Weather or time-of-day considerations
- Challenge/passphrases if friendly ID is a concern
- Extraction triggers or abort conditions

---

## 🔚 Final Note

The purpose of a briefing is not to control — it's to align. You’re not handing your team a plan. You’re handing them a mission.

> “Clarity enables autonomy. Intent enables execution.”
