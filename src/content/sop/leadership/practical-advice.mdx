# Leadership in Practice

Theory only gets you so far. In the field, leadership is about staying ahead of the moment, keeping your team focused, and making decisions that move the mission forward.

These practices are built from real experiences — they work under pressure.

---

## Have a Plan, Own the Plan

- Your job isn’t just to relay a mission — it’s to shape it and take responsibility for its outcome.
- Even if the plan changes, your team needs to see that **someone owns it** and is thinking ahead.
- Accept input, but **make decisions**. A plan with buy-in is good, but a leader without direction stalls everyone.

---

## Assume Incomplete Intel

- You will never have perfect information.
- Do not wait for clarity that won’t come — lead anyway.
- Good leaders focus the group **despite uncertainty**.

---

## Delegate to Create Decision Space

- Assign tasks early so you can focus on coordination and timing.
- Use fireteam leads and 2ICs to manage movement and spacing.
- A leader with no decision space becomes a bottleneck.

---

## Keep the Team Informed

- Let your team know what phase of the mission they’re in.
- If plans change, say so quickly and clearly.
- Never assume everyone heard — confirm with sub-leads.

---

## Celebrate Successes

- Acknowledge when things go right.
- Build trust by highlighting solid execution.
- Morale rises when leaders give credit where it’s due.

---

## Give Positive Feedback

- Tell people when they’re doing a good job.
- Recognition builds buy-in and repeat performance.
- Feedback doesn’t always have to be corrective.

---

## Address Failures With Purpose

- When mistakes happen, call them out **professionally and clearly**.
- Focus on the **behavior or breakdown**, not the person.
- Reinforce SOPs or expectations right after the op or in debrief.

---

## Keep the Team in the Fight

- Know when to pull back, regroup, or shift plans — but keep momentum.
- Give fallback orders quickly and clearly.
- Leadership is about keeping forward pressure, even if direction changes.

---

## Plan for Sustainment

- Think ahead about ammo, medical, and CASEVAC — before contact.
- Leaders who only plan for the fight will lose it during the recovery.
- Build resupply, handoff, and rally phases into your thinking.

---

## Stay in the Loop: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act

- Be present. Watch your team. Check your sectors.
- Reassess often. If the situation shifts, so must your decisions.
- Leadership isn’t about having a script — it’s about running the loop under fire.

> If you're overloaded, you're not leading — you're managing a collapse. Step back, delegate, and re-center.
