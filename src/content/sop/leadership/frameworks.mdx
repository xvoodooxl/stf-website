# METT-TC and OODA

SPECTRE leaders use structured frameworks to stay grounded in the mission, especially when stress, ambiguity, or time constraints make it hard to think clearly.

This document introduces two core tools used during both planning and execution:

- **METT-TC** – For building structured plans
- **OODA** – For adapting dynamically in the field

---

## METT-TC: Building the Plan

**Mission, Enemy, Terrain & Weather, Troops Available, Time Available, Civilians**

Use this framework before or during planning to ensure you aren’t overlooking critical variables.

### 1. Mission

- What is the actual objective?
- What is the desired end state?

### 2. Enemy

- What do we know or suspect about the enemy?
- What can they do to disrupt us?

### 3. Terrain and Weather

- Where are the hazards, high ground, dead zones?
- How will visibility, sound, or movement be affected?

### 4. Troops Available

- Who do you have?
- What are their roles, loadouts, and limitations?

### 5. Time Available

- How much time do you have for planning, staging, movement, and execution?

### 6. Civilian Considerations

- Are civilians present?
- What ROE applies?
- How do non-combatants affect your options?

> METT-TC helps you **construct a plan that considers reality**, not just intention.

## OODA: Leading During Execution

**Observe, Orient, Decide, Act**

Use this mental loop during missions to maintain forward momentum and make smart decisions on the fly.

### 1. Observe

- What’s happening?
- Are we still aligned with the plan?

### 2. Orient

- What does this mean?
- Are we in danger, behind schedule, out of sync?

### 3. Decide

- What should change?
- Who needs to know?

### 4. Act

- Implement the change and issue clear instructions
- Re-enter the loop

> OODA helps you **lead without freezing** when the unexpected happens.

## When to Use These

| Situation                    | Use     |
| ---------------------------- | ------- |
| Mission planning or briefing | METT-TC |
| Leading under pressure       | OODA    |
| Debrief review of decisions  | Both    |

## Final Thought

Leadership isn’t about reacting emotionally or guessing under pressure. It’s about applying structure to your thinking — fast, consistently, and with purpose.

> Use the framework. Trust the loop. Lead forward.
