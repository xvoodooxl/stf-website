# Leadership

In SPECTRE, leadership is not about titles — it’s about outcomes. Anyone can be in charge, but not everyone can lead under pressure.

This section exists to develop leaders who:

- Take ownership of the mission
- Empower their teams
- Make decisions with confidence and clarity
- Keep their people focused and fighting
- Adapt under stress, and finish what they start

## What Makes a Leader in SPECTRE

We expect our leaders to:

- Communicate clearly
- Delegate effectively
- Think ahead
- Keep their team focused
- Lead from the front, even if not physically there

Leadership is not perfection — it’s persistence, presence, and preparation.
