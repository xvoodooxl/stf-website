# Feedback & Morale

Leadership is not just about tasks and tactics — it's about people. How you manage morale, give feedback, and handle team dynamics has a direct impact on operational performance.

The best teams aren't just skilled — they're invested. They trust their leadership, they feel ownership of the mission, and they want to improve.

---

## Why This Matters

- Builds trust and cohesion across the team
- Encourages learning and long-term improvement
- Maintains focus and energy during longer ops
- Prevents burnout, blame loops, or disengagement

---

## Reinforce the Right Things

Don’t just correct what went wrong — **acknowledge what went right**.

- “Great spacing on that approach.”
- “Team 1 handled the breach exactly as briefed.”
- “Radio discipline was excellent throughout.”

This sets a positive baseline. When feedback comes later, it feels like part of a shared goal — not punishment.

## How to Give Feedback That Sticks

1. **Be specific**

   - Vague: “Good job.”
   - Useful: “You kept the rear covered during that withdrawal — that saved us.”

2. **Be timely**

   - Address big items right after the op, not hours later
   - For smaller items, use the AAR to bring them up constructively

3. **Focus on behaviors, not identity**
   - “You were out of position” is useful
   - “You’re bad at this” is not — and doesn’t belong in SPECTRE

## Keep the Debrief Balanced

In After Action Reviews:

- Highlight a few wins before critiques
- Frame critiques around _improvement_, not blame
- Let team leads speak before you do
- Call out **specific corrective actions**, not just what went wrong

---

## Give Credit, Not Just Direction

Don’t be the leader who only speaks when something breaks.

- Give quiet nods or affirmations during ops
- Use comms check-ins to boost confidence: “Good hold, keep it up.”
- Let high performers know they’re seen

Morale isn't about cheering. It's about knowing the team is _winning together_.

---

## Correct with Purpose

- When mistakes happen, be clear and calm
- Fix it, explain why it mattered, and move forward
- Avoid public shaming — especially during the op

Leadership doesn’t ignore errors. It addresses them **professionally**.

---

## Watch for Morale Signals

Signs of slippage:

- Comms get sloppy
- Movement slows
- Jokes start during contact
- Players go quiet after feedback

If you see these, pause, check in, or simplify. Not every op needs to be a grind.

---

## Final Thought

Performance improves when people feel safe to fail, motivated to succeed, and confident that their efforts matter.

> A focused team is a strong team. Feedback isn’t just tactical — it’s human.
