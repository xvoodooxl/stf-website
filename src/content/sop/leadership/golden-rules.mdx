# Golden Rules of Leadership

In the field, things move fast. You won’t always have time to think through every possibility. That’s why SPECTRE leaders operate by three golden rules that serve as anchors under pressure.

These aren’t just suggestions — they are the habits that distinguish a steady leader from a reactive one.

## 1. Delegate, Delegate, Delegate

Leadership isn’t about doing everything — it’s about enabling others to act.

- Assign roles and responsibilities clearly
- Trust your sub-leads and fireteam members to carry out tasks
- Keep your own bandwidth free for decisions and communication

A team that’s properly delegated is a team that doesn’t fall apart when the unexpected hits.

## 2. Communicate Clearly and Briefly

Say what needs to be said — no more, no less.

- Use plain, direct language
- Prioritize brevity, especially over radio
- Confirm when needed, but avoid repetition

Your team should never be confused about what the plan is or who’s in charge of it.

## 3. Focus the Group’s Efforts

Your primary job as a leader is to keep your team aligned and effective.

- Remove distractions
- Reinforce the objective and current task
- Cut noise, build clarity

Disorganized teams don’t fail because they lack skill — they fail because no one is focused.

## Applying the Rules in Practice

Good leadership is a mindset. If you feel overwhelmed, ask:

- Who can I delegate to right now?
- What’s the one thing my team needs to hear?
- What is the objective, and are we moving toward it?

These questions help you re-center and stay effective under pressure.
