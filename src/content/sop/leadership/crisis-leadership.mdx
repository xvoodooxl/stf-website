# Leadership in Crisis

Every plan has a breaking point. What separates successful teams from failures is what happens **after** that point is reached.

Crisis leadership isn’t about having the right answer — it’s about making the next decision with confidence, keeping your team moving, and reestablishing structure as fast as possible.

---

## Common Crisis Scenarios

- Your Team Lead is down or disconnected
- Comms are jammed or out entirely
- Mission objective is compromised or invalid
- Friendly units are misidentified or scattered
- Enemy presence is greater than expected

These moments are where leaders are tested — not for perfect execution, but for clarity and control under pressure.

---

## What to Do First: Stabilize

1. **Take control immediately**

   - If you’re the 2IC, step in
   - If no one is taking control, **do it** — even temporarily

2. **Confirm what you know**

   - Who’s still up?
   - Where are you?
   - Is the objective still valid?

3. **Issue short, clear orders**
   - “Hold this building”
   - “Regroup on me”
   - “Fall back to Rally 1”

---

## What to Do Next: Rebuild the Plan

1. **Reorient on the mission**

   - Are you still in a position to complete it?

2. **Reassign roles if needed**

   - Task surviving elements with what they can accomplish

3. **Simplify**
   - Drop complexity — move, regroup, and regain tempo
   - Execute clean, executable goals with what you have

---

## Mindset: Calm, Not Casual

- You don’t need to sound calm — you need to sound **decisive**
- Keep your comms focused and authoritative
- If the team believes in the next step, they’ll move

> Even if it’s not the perfect call, a clear decision is better than none.

---

## Use Pre-Briefed Fallbacks

If you followed SOP, your team should already know:

- Rally points
- Fallback conditions
- Who’s in charge if leadership is lost
- What to do if comms go dark

**Crisis leadership begins before contact.** If you're building this in the moment, you’re already late.

---

## Don't Wait to Lead

If no one else is stepping up — you step up.

Leadership isn’t rank. It’s action. If you can keep your team alive, focused, and moving — you're the leader now.

---

## Final Reminder

Crisis leadership is not about being perfect. It's about **moving forward with purpose**, under pressure, when things feel like they're falling apart.

> A bad plan executed now beats a perfect plan executed too late.
