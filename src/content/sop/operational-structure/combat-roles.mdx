# ðŸª– Standard Combat Roles

This section defines the **core combat roles** used across all units within the SPECTRE Task Force (STF). These roles ensure consistency in team composition and simplify mission planning for all operations.

All roles are grounded in gameplay practicality and are used across all supported games (ARMA 3, ARMA Reforger, Ground Branch).

> These roles are **operational**, not hierarchicalâ€”your role in a fireteam does not correspond to any community rank or leadership status.

## ðŸ§© Role Philosophy

All SPECTRE units are structured around **modular combat roles** that adapt to mission needs. Roles are defined by equipment and taskingâ€”not rigid positions in the formation.

Each unit applies these roles differently, based on its team structure:

- **GRYPHONs**: Operate in **4-man fireteams**, organized into **two 2-man buddy teams**
- **DEVILBIRDs**: Operate in **6-man sections**, organized into **two 3-man buddy teams**

Regardless of team size, each member is expected to be flexible and capable of rotating through any stack position.
