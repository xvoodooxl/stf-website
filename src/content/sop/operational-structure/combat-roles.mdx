# SPECTRE Task Force Combat Roles

This section defines the **core combat roles** used across all units within the SPECTRE Task Force (STF). These roles ensure consistency in team composition and simplify mission planning for all operations.

All roles are grounded in gameplay practicality and are used across supported games such as ARMA 3, ARMA Reforger, and Ground Branch.

<Callout type='info'>
  These roles are **operational**, not hierarchical—your role in a fireteam does
  not correspond to any community rank or leadership status.
  <b />
  This page is **role guideline** only. It describes responsibilities and
  tactical functions—not strict loadouts. Platform-specific kit regulations and
  loadout guidance will be addressed in a separate section. Expect kit variation
  across supported games.

## Role Philosophy

All SPECTRE units are structured around **modular combat roles** that adapt to mission needs. Roles are defined by equipment and tasking—not rigid positions in formation.

Each unit applies these roles differently, based on its structure:

- **SPECTRE Gryphons**: Operate in 4-man fireteams organized as two 2-man buddy teams
- **SPECTRE Devilbirds**: Operate in 6-man sections, made up of two 3-man buddy teams

Regardless of team size, each member is expected to be flexible and capable of rotating through any stack position.

## Deployment Principles

- Team Leaders assign roles based on mission type, terrain, and available equipment.
- All team members are expected to cross-train and rotate through responsibilities.
- Role kits are tools—not ranks. Flexibility and proficiency are prioritized over rigid assignments.

> Support elements such as aviation, fire support, or ISR operate under specialized doctrine not covered in this section.
