# Operational Structure

## Community vs. Fiction

This section defines the **fictional in-game organization** of the SPECTRE Task Force (STF). It is used during operations to establish a shared framework for unit structure, combat roles, and mission execution.

<Callout emoji='⚠️' type='warning'>
  This system does **not represent community ranks, leadership, or
  administrative responsibilities**. It exists solely to support immersive,
  tactical gameplay across supported titles like ARMA 3, ARMA Reforger, and
  Ground Branch.

## Operational Units

The core combat branches of STF. These teams execute the primary combat missions under the STF charter.

| Unit                                                                          | Description                                                         |

| [SPECTRE Devilbirds](/sop/operational-structure/operational-units/devilbirds) | Rapid-response light infantry for direct assaults and area control. |

## Support Units

STF maintains specialized support elements to enhance operational reach and capability. These units may be directly attached to fireteams or operate as independent assets under command coordination.

| [Indirect Fire (Hammer)](/sop/operational-structure/support-units/indirect-fire)   | Mortar and artillery teams with 5-line support procedures.      |
| [ISR (Sentinel)](/sop/operational-structure/support-units/isr)                     | Reconnaissance, drone ops, and intel gathering.                 |

## How STF Operates In-Game

SPECTRE’s operational structure is built to support immersive, modular gameplay across tactical FPS titles like ARMA 3, ARMA Reforger, and Ground Branch.

### Modularity in Team Composition

- All units follow a standardized role system: Rifleman, AT, AutoRifleman, DMR, Medic, Sapper.
- Loadouts are chosen per mission; fireteam composition remains consistent regardless of game.
- Both Gryphons and Devilbirds emphasize flexibility—every operator can rotate stack positions and adapt to changing mission needs.

### Combined Arms Execution

- Gryphons specialize in stealth entries, direct action, and surgical strikes.
- Devilbirds provide fire superiority, area control, and QRF for larger operations.
- Support units such as Corsair (aviation) and Hammer (indirect fire) are integrated by mission planners as force multipliers.

### Decentralized Control & Immersive Hierarchy

- Gryphons operate in autonomous 4-man teams with no dependence on external command once deployed.
- Devilbirds operate in 6-man sections under platoon-level coordination when scaled up.
- All leadership is contextual and based on mission planning—not community rank—ensuring immersive and fluid gameplay leadership.
