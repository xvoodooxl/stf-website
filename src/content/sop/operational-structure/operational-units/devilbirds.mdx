## Operational Principles

- **Fireteam Redundancy**: Leadership is mirrored across buddy teams.
- **Flexibility First**: Riflemen are cross-trained in multiple mission profiles.
- **Fire Superiority by Design**: Two support gunners per section ensure continuous suppression.
- **Scalable Command**: Platoon HQ enables Devilbirds to lead multi-section operations independently.

---

## Section Doctrine

- **Command Delegation**: Sections and buddy teams are trusted to act under mission intent.
- **Cover and Maneuver**: One team provides suppression while the other advances.
- **Fire Discipline**: Sectors and priority targets are maintained across the section.
- **Joint Integration**: Devilbirds work in tandem with Gryphons and support elements to achieve force superiority.
