### Platoon Roles

- Coordinate DEVILBIRD sections
- Integrate support units (Corsair, Hammer, Sentinel)
- Maintain contact with GRYPHON detachments and 1PH elements

---

## Operational Principles

- **Fireteam Redundancy**: Leadership is mirrored across buddy teams.
- **Flexibility First**: Riflemen can be assigned specialty roles per mission.
- **Fire Superiority by Design**: Two support gunners per team ensures constant suppression.
- **Scalable Command**: Platoon HQ allows DEVILBIRDs to function independently in multi-section ops.

---

## Section Doctrine

- **Command Delegation**: Sections and buddy teams operate with initiative under broad intent.
- **Cover and Maneuver**: One buddy team supports while the other advances.
- **Fire Discipline**: Sections maintain overlapping sectors and suppress key threats.
- **Joint Integration**: DEVILBIRDs reinforce Gryphons, control flanks, or provide QRF.
