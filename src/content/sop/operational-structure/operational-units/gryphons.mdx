# SPECTRE Gryphons

## Overview

The **SPECTRE Gryphons** are STF’s premier covert direct-action element. Comprised of elite multinational operators, Gryphons are deployed for missions that require **speed**, **precision**, and **complete deniability**.

Operating in small, tightly coordinated fireteams, Gryphons excel in environments where surgical strikes, stealth infiltration, and urban close-quarters dominance are required.

---

## Unit Profile

- **Type**: Covert Black Operations
- **Structure**: 4-man fireteams (2x2 buddy teams)
- **Environment**: Urban, CQB, non-permissive zones
- **Gear**: Sanitized, unmarked, and sourced to prevent traceability
- **Comms**: Short, closed-loop; radio discipline emphasized

> Gryphons are not used for prolonged area control or frontline defense. They are a scalpel, not a sledgehammer.

## Fireteam Structure

Gryphon teams operate in fixed **4-man fireteams**, built around **two buddy teams**. There are no fixed stack positions—every operator is expected to fulfill any role as needed.

### Standard 4-Man Layout

| Position             | Description                                                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Team Leader (TL)** | Oversees team movement, coordination, and comms with command.   |
| **2IC (Deputy TL)**  | Leads second buddy team and takes over if TL is down.           |
| **Operator A**       | Rifleman baseline; may be assigned a specialist role as needed. |
| **Operator B**       | Rifleman baseline; may be assigned a specialist role as needed. |

> Loadouts are chosen based on mission type, not rank or role permanence.

## Operational Principles

- **Deniability**: All gear is untraceable; no identifying markers.
- **Speed & Violence of Action**: Breaches are rapid, overwhelming, and deliberate.
- **Sanitized Comms**: Minimal radio chatter. Precision language.
- **Autonomy**: Fireteams are capable of completing mission objectives without external support.

---

## Fireteam Doctrine

- **Modularity over Expansion**: Gryphon fireteams remain 4-man elements. Larger groups are built by linking teams, not expanding them.
- **All-Role Proficiency**: All members are trained to lead, breach, cover, or support.
- **Role Clarity**: Team leads assign kits pre-mission to match objectives, not based on permanent loadouts.
