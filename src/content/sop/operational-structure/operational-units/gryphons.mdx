# SPECTRE GRYPHONs

## Overview

The **SPECTRE GRYPHONs** are STFâ€™s premier covert direct-action element. Comprised of elite multinational operators, Gryphons are deployed for missions that require **speed**, **precision**, and **complete deniability**.

Operating in small, tightly coordinated fireteams, Gryphons excel in environments where surgical strikes, stealth infiltration, and urban close-quarters dominance are required.

---

## Unit Profile

- **Type**: Covert Black Operations
- **Structure**: 4-man fireteams (2x2 buddy teams)
- **Environment**: Urban, CQB, non-permissive zones
- **Gear**: Sanitized, unmarked, and sourced to prevent traceability
- **Comms**: Short, closed-loop; radio discipline emphasized

> GRYPHONs are not used for prolonged area control or frontline defense. They are a scalpel, not a sledgehammer.

## Mission Set

| Mission Type                   | Description                                                        |

| **Direct Action Raids**        | CQB assaults on enemy compounds, strongholds, and urban positions. |

| **Interdiction**               | Disruption of enemy logistics, movement, or command elements.      |
| **Clandestine Recon**          | Covert recon or overwatch operations in denied areas.              |
| **Joint Force Breach**         | Executes surgical entry while DEVILBIRDs or 1PH hold or contain.   |

## Fireteam Structure

GRYPHON teams operate in fixed **4-man fireteams**, built around **two buddy teams**. There are no fixed stack positionsâ€”every operator is expected to fulfill any role as needed.

### Standard 4-Man Layout

| Position             | Description                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Team Leader (TL)** | Oversees team movement, coordination, and comms with command.      |
| **2IC (Deputy TL)**  | Leads second buddy team and takes over if TL is down.              |
| **Operator A**       | Rifleman baseline; can be equipped as Sapper, AT, or Breacher.     |
| **Operator B**       | Rifleman baseline; can be equipped as Medic, AutoRifleman, or DMR. |

> Loadouts are chosen based on mission type, not rank or role permanence.

## Optional Role Kits

The following kits may be used by team members depending on mission objectives:

- **Sapper** â€“ Carries demolition, charges, or breaching tools.
- **Combat Medic** â€“ Stabilizes casualties and supports movement.
- **Designated Marksman** â€“ Mid-range overwatch with backup CQB capability.
- **AutoRifleman** â€“ Provides suppressive fire in room entries or urban overwatch.
- **AT Rifleman (Light/Heavy)** â€“ Neutralizes enemy vehicles or fortified positions.

### CQB / Direct Action

- TL (Rifleman)
- Operator A (Sapper)
- 2IC (AutoRifleman)
- Operator B (Medic)

### HVI Snatch / Kill

- TL (Rifleman + stuns)
- Operator A (Breacher)
- 2IC (DMR)
- Operator B (Medic or AT)

### Reconnaissance-In-Force

- TL (Binos, drone tablet)
- Operator A (Rifleman + explosives)
- 2IC (Marksman)
- Operator B (Medic or AT-Light)

## Operational Principles

- **Deniability**: Operators use untraceable gear. Serial numbers are removed, faces are covered, and no identifiable patches are wornâ€”even in training.
- **Speed & Violence of Action**: Breaches are swift, controlled, and overwhelming.
- **Sanitized Comms**: No chatter. Only what's needed to execute.
- **Independent Autonomy**: GRYPHONs are designed to operate without external support when needed.

---

## Fireteam Doctrine

- **Modularity over expansion**: Gryphon teams stay 4-man, even under pressure. Larger elements are formed by combining fireteams, not expanding one.
- **All-Role Proficiency**: Stack positions are not pre-assigned. Every member is trained to lead, breach, or cover.
- **Role clarity**: Loadouts should reflect tasking. Team leads brief role kits pre-mission based on objectives.
