# Operational Units

This document provides a side-by-side comparison of the SPECTRE Task Force's two primary combat units: the **SPECTRE Gryphons** and the **SPECTRE Devilbirds**. These units serve distinct operational purposes and are deployed based on mission type, terrain, and strategic objectives.

## Unit Comparison

| Feature              | SPECTRE Gryphons                            | SPECTRE Devilbirds                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**             | Covert Black Operations                     | Conventional Light Infantry                   |
| **Team Size**        | 4-man fireteams (2x2 buddy teams)           | 6-man sections (2x3 buddy teams)              |
| **Operational Role** | Surgical, deniable strikes                  | Area control, fire support, rapid response    |
| **Deployment Model** | Autonomous, fireteam-level ops              | Section and platoon-level deployments         |
| **Environment**      | Urban, CQB, high-risk/denied zones          | Open/mixed terrain, urban, sustained contact  |
| **Comms Protocol**   | Closed-loop, short comms                    | Section and platoon net coordination          |
| **Loadout Strategy** | Mission-adapted, sanitized gear             | Standardized kits, NATO-style loadouts        |
| **Role Flexibility** | No fixed stack roles; all-role proficiency  | Built-in fire support and command redundancy  |
| **Support Use**      | Rarely used; Gryphons operate independently | Actively coordinate with aviation and IDF     |
| **Unit Symbolism**   | "Eagles" – surgical, silent, unseen         | "Para-Hussars" – swift, overwhelming presence |

## Deployment Philosophy

### SPECTRE Gryphons

- Used when deniability and precision are paramount.
- Fireteams are tightly self-contained and operate with minimal support.
- Missions include HVT raids, black recon, and sabotage in denied areas.
- Fireteam roles shift per mission—everyone is trained to breach, cover, or lead.

### SPECTRE Devilbirds

- Deployed in scenarios requiring sustained combat or visible force.
- Operate as scalable elements—section, platoon, or joint-force formations.
- Ideal for area denial, support-by-fire, and heavy contact response.
- Each section is internally redundant, able to maneuver and respond autonomously.

## Task Force Integration

SPECTRE operations often blend both units to achieve mission objectives:

- **Gryphons** execute surgical entry or strikes.
- **Devilbirds** control perimeters, block enemy movement, or act as QRF.
- **Support Units** (e.g., Corsair, Hammer, Sentinel) extend operational reach based on mission needs.

This doctrinal separation allows STF to adapt quickly, whether the task is covert action or full-spectrum light infantry engagement.
