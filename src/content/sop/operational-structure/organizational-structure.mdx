# SPECTRE Task Force Organizational Structure

This document outlines the **fictional operational structure** of the SPECTRE Task Force (STF). It serves as a reference for understanding how command, combat, and support elements are arranged during in-game operations.

<Callout emoji='⚠️' type='warning'>
  This is a roleplay and gameplay-facing system only. It is **not related to the
  community’s real-world leadership, ranks, or moderation structure**.

## Integration and Interoperability

### Operational Coordination

All tasking flows through the **Operations Directorate (“Overwatch”)**, which integrates intelligence gathered by **Overlord** and logistical constraints provided by **Atlas**. While some units—such as SPECTRE Gryphons—may operate independently during execution, all mission planning and inter-unit coordination is centralized and streamlined through STF’s command infrastructure.

### Combined Arms and Cross-Unit Deployment

STF operations are designed around the principle of modularity. Operational and support units are combined depending on mission scope, terrain, and deniability constraints. A typical raid might involve:

- **Direct action teams** (e.g., Gryphons) executing precision tasks
- **Assault or containment elements** (e.g., Devilbirds) securing perimeters and responding to contingencies
- **Support detachments** such as **Corsair** (airlift), **Hammer** (indirect fire), or **Sentinel** (real-time ISR) enhancing capability at critical phases

This joint-force approach allows STF to dynamically scale from a single fireteam to full-spectrum coordinated engagements while preserving unit autonomy and clarity of task.
