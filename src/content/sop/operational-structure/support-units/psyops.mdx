# Wraith – PsyOps and Civil Affairs

## Overview

**Wraith** is SPECTRE’s unit dedicated to psychological operations, civilian engagement, and population control in operational areas. Its objective is to shape the battlefield before and beyond the use of kinetic force—through influence, disruption, and narrative control.

Wraith is a non-playable unit in nearly all scenarios and functions through mission design elements, scripted interactions, and environmental storytelling.

## Role in Operations

Wraith contributes to mission success by:

- **Disrupting enemy morale and cohesion** through deception, false signals, or psychological pressure
- **Shaping civilian perception** in areas of operation through communication or show-of-force
- **Executing non-lethal influence** strategies such as broadcasts, staged events, or controlled rumors
- **Managing civilian actors** during urban or populated-area missions

---

## Integration and Control

Wraith operates under the direct planning of:

- **Overwatch (Operations Directorate)** for pre-mission narrative and influence planning
- **Mission Commanders / Scenario Designers** to simulate presence and behavioral shifts

> Wraith is often felt rather than seen. When used properly, it alters how the enemy and local population act before the first shot is fired.

## Implementation Considerations

- Civilian interaction mechanics should be briefed pre-mission when Wraith is present
- Intelligence from Wraith may be embedded into the mission flow (documents, informants, audio, etc.)
- Wraith actions should not conflict with Rules of Engagement (ROE) unless explicitly scripted
- Players should be prepared for non-standard mission outcomes due to Wraith activity
