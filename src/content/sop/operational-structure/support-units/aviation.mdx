# Corsair – Aviation Squadron

## Overview

The **Corsair** Aviation Squadron provides the SPECTRE Task Force with air mobility, rapid deployment, and close air support (CAS) capabilities. These assets are a mission-critical component during insertions, extractions, and direct engagements requiring vertical envelopment or air-delivered firepower.

Corsair units are one of the few support elements frequently represented by players, particularly in large-scale operations where mobility and air superiority are decisive factors.

## Role in Operations

Corsair supports operations in the following capacities:

- **Insertion and Extraction**: Transport of Gryphon fireteams or Devilbird sections into and out of contested areas.
- **Rapid Redeployment**: Movement of QRF elements across the battlespace.
- **Close Air Support**: Precision engagement of targets in support of ground elements when authorized.
- **Logistics Drops**: Delivery of ammunition, equipment, or medical supplies to remote positions.
- **Aerial Reconnaissance**: Observation and overwatch support from rotary or fixed-wing assets.

## Coordination and Control

Corsair flights operate under direct coordination with:

- **Platoon HQ / Command Elements** for insertion timing and LZ security
- **JTAC / Forward Observers** for CAS targeting and approval
- **Providence** (Logistics) for aerial delivery of supplies

> Corsair assets must maintain clear radio comms and follow all SOP procedures for air-ground coordination.

## Deployment Notes

- Use of Corsair should be **mission-planned**, with clear insertion/extraction protocols.
- Aircraft must never loiter over target zones unless directly supporting ground elements.
- Pilot survivability and asset conservation are priority concerns—unauthorized risk-taking may compromise the mission.

When flown by players, Corsair crews are expected to:

- Communicate clearly with ground forces
- Maintain airspace awareness
- Adhere to load/unload discipline and landing zone security
