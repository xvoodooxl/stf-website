# Sentinel â€“ Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)

## Overview

The **Sentinel** ISR element provides SPECTRE with critical battlefield awareness through reconnaissance, drone surveillance, and target tracking. Sentinel units are typically non-playable and represented through scripting or mission design, though some missions may incorporate player-controlled drone teams or forward scouts when appropriate.

Sentinel exists to inform decision-making at the command and fireteam level by identifying threats before contact is made.

## Role in Operations

Sentinel contributes to:

- **Pre-Mission Reconnaissance**: Scouting AO before deployment to identify enemy positions, terrain, and movement patterns
- **Live ISR Feeds**: Providing real-time battlefield awareness via UAV or observer elements
- **Target Identification**: Locating high-value targets, enemy vehicles, or defensive positions
- **Route Surveillance**: Monitoring roads or key terrain for ambushes or movement

---

## Integration

Sentinel supports:

- **Operations Directorate (Overwatch)** for planning and asset tasking
- **JTACs / FOs** for target designation
- **Gryphon and Devilbird units** during infiltration or assault planning

Information gathered by Sentinel is distributed via radio, intelligence reports, or mission briefings.

> Effective ISR reduces risk and increases mission efficiency. Units should treat Sentinel intel as mission-critical and time-sensitive.

## Deployment Considerations

- Sentinel assets should operate from concealed or elevated positions
- UAVs should maintain altitude and pathing to reduce detection
- Forward scouts must avoid contact and prioritize survival and observation
- When represented by players, drone or recon operators must maintain clear comms and avoid overextension
