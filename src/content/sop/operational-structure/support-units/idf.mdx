# Hammer – Indirect Fire Support

## Overview

**Hammer** represents SPECTRE’s mortar and artillery capabilities, responsible for delivering indirect fire in support of ground operations. These assets are rarely player-controlled and are typically simulated through scripting, AI, or pre-arranged fire missions.

Indirect fire is coordinated by command elements or Forward Observers (FO) and must follow strict communication and deconfliction procedures to prevent friendly fire.

## Role in Operations

Hammer provides:

- **Fire Missions**: Targeted engagement of enemy positions beyond line of sight
- **Suppression**: Disrupting or pinning enemy movement through area denial
- **Destruction**: Neutralizing fortified positions or vehicles from range
- **Illumination / Smoke**: Supporting night ops or masked movement

---

## Coordination and Targeting

All Hammer fire missions must be coordinated through:

- **Forward Observers (FOs)** or designated JTACs
- **Platoon HQ** or **Operations Directorate (Overwatch)**

Targeting is conducted using grid coordinates, laser designators, visual markers, or TRPs (Target Reference Points). All calls for fire must follow closed-loop communication standards.

> No fire mission is authorized without command confirmation. Misuse may result in friendly fire or mission compromise.

---

## Usage Considerations

- Indirect fire should be pre-planned when possible
- Firing near friendly units requires **Danger Close** authorization
- Effectiveness should be confirmed with **Battle Damage Assessments (BDA)** after impact
- Hammer elements should remain protected and concealed; they are high-value targets
