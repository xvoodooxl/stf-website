# Warhorse â€“ Mechanized Support

## Overview

**Warhorse** provides SPECTRE with armored and motorized support elements capable of enhancing ground force mobility, protection, and firepower. These units are particularly useful in operations where extended overland travel, convoy protection, or direct armored support is required.

While often represented through AI elements, Warhorse may be assigned to players during mechanized or convoy-based missions.

---

## Role in Operations

Warhorse enhances combat effectiveness through:

- **Armored Transport**: Moving fireteams or sections under protection in contested zones.
- **Convoy Security**: Escorting logistics elements or mission-critical convoys through hostile areas.
- **Fire Support**: Providing mobile weapons platforms for area denial, overwatch, or direct engagements.
- **Blocking and Containment**: Establishing mobile barriers to enemy movement in open terrain.

## Integration and Command

Mechanized assets are coordinated by:

- **Platoon HQ or Operations Directorate**, depending on scale
- **Devilbird Section Leads** during ground maneuver coordination
- **Providence** during multi-vehicle logistics movements

> Armored vehicles are force multipliers but must be used with caution. Overextension or poor coordination can expose them to unnecessary risk.

## Usage Guidelines

- Vehicles should not lead patrols through blind terrain without reconnaissance.
- Dismount procedures should be clearly communicated to transported personnel.
- Fire discipline and range awareness are critical when supporting friendly infantry.
- Vehicle crew coordination with infantry elements is expected at all times.
