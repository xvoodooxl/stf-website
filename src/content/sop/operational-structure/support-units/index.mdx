# Support Units

This page outlines the purpose and structure of STF’s dedicated support units—non-combat elements that enable force projection, sustainment, and information dominance in SPECTRE operations.

> While some support units may occasionally be represented as playable roles (e.g., aviation, logistics), the vast majority are treated as non-playable, command-directed assets. Their presence in operations is simulated through mission scripting, AI control, or coordination via mission planning.

## Role in Operations

Support units exist to extend the operational reach of Gryphons and Devilbirds. They allow combat elements to focus on the tactical mission by providing:

- **Mobility** (air, vehicle, or convoy)
- **Sustainment** (resupply, medical, and equipment)
- **Intelligence** (surveillance, analysis, communication)
- **Force Multiplication** (indirect fire, psychological disruption)

These assets are requested via command channels or pre-planned into missions through the Operations Directorate (“Overwatch”) and coordinated via platoon or section leadership.

## Doctrinal Integration

Support units are not standalone entities. They are force enablers that operate in tandem with combat units under the direction of the Operations Directorate. Their use should:

- Be pre-scripted or triggered by command elements
- Reflect the logistical or informational needs of the mission
- Reinforce immersion without requiring constant player control

> When represented as AI or environmental elements, they should remain consistent in behavior, responsiveness, and in-universe capability.

For scenarios where support units are player-controlled (e.g., piloted transport, live logistics), clear coordination with the mission commander or platoon HQ is required.
