# Providence – Logistics Unit

## Overview

The **Providence** logistics unit is responsible for maintaining the operational tempo of SPECTRE ground elements by enabling sustained resupply, transport, and recovery. In many missions, logistics is represented as an abstract system, but in scenarios where assets and complexity allow, Providence may be operated by players.

Providence plays a critical behind-the-scenes role in ensuring that combat units remain armed, mobile, and able to complete mission objectives.

## Role in Operations

Providence supports operations through:

- **Ammunition and Equipment Resupply**: Delivering necessary supplies to forward elements.
- **Medical and Casualty Support**: Transport of injured personnel to safe zones or medical facilities.
- **Vehicle Recovery and Repair**: Retrieving damaged vehicles and performing basic field repairs or swaps.
- **Mobility Support**: Providing ground transport in support of redeployment or reinforcement efforts.
- **Pre-Mission Staging**: Ensuring all assigned units are equipped and ready prior to insertion.

## Deployment and Integration

Providence elements typically operate in coordination with:

- **Platoon HQ / Section Leads** for priority tasking
- **Corsair (Aviation)** when aerial delivery is required
- **Medical (Mercy)** to coordinate casualty handoffs or medevac

> In most scenarios, Providence is AI-directed or abstracted through scripting. When operated by players, logistics personnel are expected to follow standard comms protocol and maintain responsive, task-driven behavior.

## Operational Considerations

- Requests for Providence support should be made through command channels using structured reports (e.g., SITREP, LOCSTAT).
- Logistics vehicles should avoid frontline exposure unless protected by maneuver elements.
- In player-driven scenarios, Providence teams are encouraged to coordinate proactively during lulls in combat.
