# Mercy – Medical Response Team

## Overview

**Mercy** is the SPECTRE Task Force’s dedicated trauma response element. It provides stabilization, evacuation, and coordinated medical care for injured personnel during and after operations. While medical support is typically abstracted or delegated to combat medics within sections, Mercy serves as the next echelon of casualty treatment.

Mercy units are almost always non-playable and simulated through mission scripting or post-contact reinforcement logic.

## Role in Operations

Mercy supports operational continuity by:

- **Receiving and stabilizing wounded personnel** evacuated from frontline positions
- **Supporting combat medics** with advanced care and triage
- **Transporting casualties** to secured zones or extraction points
- **Providing medevac coordination** with aviation and logistics teams

---

## Integration and Usage

Mercy is activated under the direction of:

- **Platoon HQ / Section Leads** when casualty evacuation is required
- **Corsair** (aviation) for aerial medevac when available
- **Providence** (logistics) for ground transport and medical supply support

> Combat medics assigned to Gryphon or Devilbird teams are not Mercy personnel—they provide immediate trauma care and coordinate with Mercy for further treatment when required.

## Operational Notes

- Mercy locations should be secured and clearly designated in mission planning
- All units must report wounded using proper brevity (e.g., ACE Report)
- Medical requests should follow radio discipline and structured communication
- Mercy assets are considered mission-critical and should be protected accordingly
