# Patchline – Communications & Signals

## Overview

**Patchline** is responsible for ensuring secure, reliable, and scalable communications across SPECTRE operations. While often abstracted or automated, Patchline underpins the coordination between command, ground units, and support assets.

In gameplay, Patchline is usually non-playable and represented through briefing data, pre-configured radio channels, and comms infrastructure embedded into the mission.

---

## Role in Operations

Patchline supports mission success by:

- **Establishing communications infrastructure** (relays, encryption, long-range links)
- **Managing radio nets** for platoon, section, and command elements
- **Monitoring battlefield chatter** and providing technical support to resolve jamming or interference
- **Coordinating signal-based elements** such as UAV data relays, GPS beacons, or call-for-fire protocols

---

## Operational Context

Patchline works behind the scenes to maintain:

- **Synchronization** between operational elements via assigned call signs and net discipline
- **Technical consistency** in pre-mission radio assignments, especially in large-scale or combined-force scenarios
- **Integration with command** to ensure real-time access to unit reports, locations, and requests

> While players do not “play” Patchline, its success determines whether teams hear each other, whether call-ins are received, and whether fires land where they should.

## Implementation Notes

- Radio assignments (Platoon, Section, Command) should be detailed in the mission briefing
- Comms failure or disruption may be simulated for mission complexity, but should always be briefed
- Closed-loop communication protocol should be enforced in all SPECTRE operations
- Signal disruptions caused by terrain, ECM, or distance should be reflected in-game when appropriate
