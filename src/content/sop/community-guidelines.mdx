# Community Guidelines

SPECTRE employs a set of guidelines that everyone in-game must follow to ensure smooth running of our operations. All of these guidelines are subject to change at any time; To preserve the sanctity of the space and spare the time of other Warfighters, offenders may be removed, without warning, with instruction to return once all guidelines are being adhered to correctly. A list of these guidelines is below:
- All Warfighters must be in uniform, and carrying the correct kit and equipment whenever on the server, unless EXPLICITLY ordered otherwise.
  (All uniform and equipment regulation can be found here: [SPECTRE Warfighter Equipment Guide](/docs/equipment-regulations))
- All Warfighters must act with respect for ALL around them.
- All Warfighters should take accountability for mistakes, and actively work to improve on those mistakes.
- All Warfighters should stay focused and immersed when operating, to preserve the immersion of others.
- No intentional mic peaking, hindering soundboard use, or needlessly weapon Checks.
- No overstepping team leads or making decisions on behalf of others. 
- No commenting on performance in the field - save it for the debrief.
- Ideas are welcome when asked, but once a decision is made by a team lead it must be followed: Their word is LAW in the field.

## Typical Server Operation
At any given time, operations may be taking place on the server. Here is the typical sequence of procedures for operations:
- **Organize** - Whoever is coordinating the operation will, if necessary, divide present Warfighters into separate elements and assign leads.
- **Briefing** - Whoever is leading or coordinating the operation will brief the deployment element on operational objectives and plans.
- **Operation** - Warfighters will deploy on said operation in an effort to complete their objectives.
- **Debriefing** - Everyone will gather, and team leads will recap positives and negatives about the operation, before individual feedback is taken from everyone.

> (This process will naturally repeat unless operation cease for any reason, for example tech issues.)
