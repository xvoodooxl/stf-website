# Community Guidelines

To maintain immersion, professionalism, and fun for all members, SPECTRE follows a clear set of guidelines. These expectations apply during all operations, training sessions, and time on official servers.

These rules exist to protect your experience and that of your teammates. Violations may result in removal from the server, with the opportunity to return once the issue is addressed.

## 🎯 Operational Conduct

- **Always show up prepared.**  
  Be in the correct uniform and kit unless otherwise instructed.

- **Respect your teammates — always.**  
  No insults, passive aggression, or disruptive behavior.

- **Own your mistakes.**  
  Admitting errors and asking for feedback is part of the learning process.

- **Stay mission-focused and immersive.**  
  When the op begins, jokes, memes, and off-topic chatter stop.

- **No mic spamming, soundboards, or unnecessary checks.**  
  Use your microphone and gear responsibly — your team relies on clarity.

## 🧭 Chain of Command

- **Respect your Team Lead’s authority.**  
  Suggestions are welcome when requested, but once the plan is set — execute without hesitation.

- **Do not overstep leadership roles.**  
  If you're not the lead, do not issue orders or make decisions on others' behalf unless directed.

- **Avoid performance commentary during the mission.**  
  Feedback belongs in the debrief, not during execution.

> In the field, your lead’s word is LAW. If you can’t follow orders, you can’t be relied upon.

## 💬 Final Note

SPECTRE maintains high standards — not to exclude, but to elevate everyone involved. If you're here, you're trusted to act like a professional. Mistakes happen. What matters is how you respond to them.

> “Discipline is not silence — it’s knowing when to speak and what matters most.”
