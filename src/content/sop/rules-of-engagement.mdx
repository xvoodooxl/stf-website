# Rules of Engagement (ROE)

Rules of Engagement define the conditions under which we are authorized to initiate combat. These protocols are essential for preventing friendly fire, protecting civilians, and ensuring that firepower is applied with discipline. ROE may be issued by Platoon Command, Section Leads, or even at the Fireteam level depending on operational needs.

<Callout type='info'>
  Default ROE is **Weapons Tight** unless otherwise ordered.
</Callout>

## Core ROE States

| **ROE Level**                 | **Engagement Rules**                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Weapons Hold**              | Fire **only** in self-defense or if an imminent threat to your team is confirmed. Report all engagements immediately.                                |
| **Weapons Tight** _(Default)_ | Engage only when a confirmed hostile presence is identified (via PID) or if directed by your team leader. Common during stealth or recon operations. |
| **Weapons Free**              | Engage any hostile target at will. Typically used when gaining fire superiority or during full-contact operations.                                   |

<Callout type='info'>
  ROE can be active **platoon-wide**, per **section**, or even per **fireteam**,
  and may change mid-mission.
</Callout>

## Positive Identification (PID)

Before engaging, you must have **Positive Identification** of a threat. PID is defined as:

- Visual confirmation of a weapon or hostile action.
- Behavior indicating clear threat (e.g., aiming at friendlies, charging position).
- Orders from leadership confirming contact is hostile.

### Hold Fire by Default

Do not fire unless:

- You have PID
- You are authorized to engage
- Your life or your team's safety is in immediate danger

<Callout>
  Unnecessary engagements break immersion, risk friendly fire, and may
  compromise the mission.
</Callout>

### Unarmed Contacts & POWs

- Do **not** engage unarmed individuals unless they demonstrate hostile intent.
- If surrendering or captured, treat as **Prisoners of War (POWs)** — **secure, disarm, and report.**
- Use **verbal commands** or hand signals to control detainees. (See [Common Phrases](/sop/communications/common-phrases))

## Threat Priority

This is a guideline for who to engage first when multiple threats are present. Always prioritize based on **immediacy of danger** and **proximity**.

**Contact Priority:**

1. Active threats (engaging or ready to engage)
2. Armed threats (not yet shooting but potentially hostile)
3. Unarmed but suspicious individuals
4. Confirmed civilians / non-combatants

<Callout type='info'>
  **Example**: If a hostile is 10 meters away and a sniper is 400 meters away,
  engage the closer threat first.
</Callout>

---

## Reporting Engagements

Anytime you break from the default ROE, or make first contact, report the situation clearly and immediately.

Examples:

- `"Jester dropped one close, east side."`
- `"Viper, contact engaged 20 meters, PID confirmed."`

<Callout type='info'>
  Reports should include **sign**, **action**, **range**, and **direction** when
  possible.
</Callout>

---

## ROE Modulation

Command may adjust ROE in response to evolving conditions. If this occurs:

- Changes must be **clearly communicated** over radio or hand signals
- All units must **acknowledge** the change (use [closed loop comms](/sop/communications/radio-communications#closed-loop-communications))
- **Leaders** are responsible for ensuring all team members understand the new engagement status

## Summary

| Term              | Meaning                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Weapons Hold**  | Fire only when directly threatened      |
| **Weapons Tight** | Engage only with PID or on order        |
| **Weapons Free**  | Engage all hostiles freely              |
| **PID**           | Positive ID — verify target is a threat |
| **POW**           | Prisoner of War — secure, don’t kill    |

By following these guidelines, we ensure **tactical discipline**, **civilian protection**, and **mission success**.
