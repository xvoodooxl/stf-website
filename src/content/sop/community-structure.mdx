# Community structure

*SPECTRE’s community structure is directly linear, meaning that all questions, concerns, etc., can be brought directly up the chain of command. All members in leadership are also a part of the **SPECTRE Task Force**, a task force of operationally elite Warfighters who serve as pillars of the community. They serve as the best of the best of SPECTRE, in both leadership and tactical capability.*

# Consideration for the Task Force
SPECTRE Warfighters may be handpicked for the Task Force individually, on the basis of operational potential, embodiment of our core pillars, and integration with current Task Force members. If selected, Warfighters will begin a Prospect phase with the SPECTRE Task Force, in which Task Force leadership will gauge their compatibility with the team. During this period prospects will undergo an array of operational and leadership training to ensure capability as a task force operative. Once training is completed and compatibility ensured, they may be sworn in as a fully-fledged Task Force Operative.
