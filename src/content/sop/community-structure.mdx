# Community Structure

SPECTRE operates under a **linear chain of command** to maintain clarity, control, and efficiency during operations and community interactions. Every member—from new Warfighters to Command—has a defined role with specific responsibilities.

If you have questions, requests, or concerns, always bring them **up your chain**. Respecting this flow keeps leadership accountable and operations running smoothly.

## ︿ SPECTRE Warfighter

- Fully integrated member of SPECTRE
- Operates at the fireteam or section level during missions
- Acts with discipline, focus, and commitment to the mission
- Supports their team and upholds immersion and standard procedures

> Being a Warfighter doesn’t limit your ability to lead or take initiative. Leadership is situational, and any player may take point when the mission demands it.

## ☆ Task Force Prospect

- Warfighter undergoing evaluation for Task Force membership
- Trains under supervision of Operatives and Lead Operatives
- Focuses on tactical performance, leadership, and team integration
- Must demonstrate initiative, consistency, and alignment with SPECTRE values

## ★ Task Force Operative

- Full member of the SPECTRE Task Force
- Frequently deployed and expected to lead mission elements
- Assists in training Warfighters and evaluating Prospects
- Maintains high tactical standards and personal initiative

## ★★ Lead Operative

- Senior operational leader within the Task Force
- Commands fireteams or sections in complex missions
- Mentors Operatives and Prospects
- Coordinates with Command and leads training and integration

## ★☆★ SPECTRE Command

- Senior leadership supporting and backfilling SPECTRE Actual
- Resolves structural, disciplinary, or operational concerns when Actual is unavailable
- Oversees doctrine development and Task Force standards
- May hold equal or higher authority than Lead Operatives depending on context

## ★★★ SPECTRE Actual

- Commander of the SPECTRE Task Force
- Oversees operations, promotions, doctrine, and community direction
- Appoints Task Force candidates and approves Operative promotions
- Leads major operations and represents SPECTRE externally

## 🔄 Chain of Command

SPECTRE maintains a **strict linear chain** during both operations and administrative processes:

- Always report to your **immediate leader** (Team Lead → Section Lead → Platoon Lead → Command)
- Do not bypass your lead unless ordered or in urgent cases
- All levels are expected to resolve issues at their level before escalating

> "Good chains don’t break — they flex and reinforce."

## 🎖️ Task Force Advancement

SPECTRE Warfighters may be handpicked for Task Force candidacy based on:

- Performance in operations
- Embodiment of our three pillars: **Discipline**, **Brotherhood**, and **Desire to Improve**
- Cultural and operational compatibility with the current Task Force

Once selected, Prospects undergo training, evaluation, and immersion testing. Successful candidates are promoted to full Operative status.

## 🧭 Rank vs. Role in the Field

Rank does not always determine leadership. SPECTRE values adaptability, humility, and trust:

- Operatives may follow Warfighters based on mission needs
- Leaders are expected to listen, guide, and learn—not just command
- Everyone fights together. No role is beneath a Warfighter, and no task is too small for Command

> Leadership is earned through consistency, trust, and execution — not just title.
