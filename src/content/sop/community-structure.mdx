# Community Structure

SPECTRE operates under a **linear chain of command** to maintain clarity, control, and efficiency during operations and community interactions. Every member—from new Warfighters to Command—has a defined role with specific responsibilities.

If you have questions, requests, or concerns, always bring them **up your chain**. Respecting this flow keeps leadership accountable and operations running smoothly.

## 🔄 Chain of Command

SPECTRE maintains a **strict linear chain** during both operations and administrative processes:

- Do not bypass your lead unless ordered or required for urgent escalation.
- All levels are expected to handle what they can before escalating issues upward.

> “Good chains don’t break — they flex and reinforce.”

## 🎖️ Task Force Advancement

SPECTRE Warfighters may be handpicked for Task Force candidacy based on:

- Demonstrated performance in operations
- Strong embodiment of our three pillars: _Discipline, Brotherhood, and Desire to Improve_
- Compatibility with current Task Force culture

Upon selection, Prospects undergo a phase of tactical training, leadership evaluation, and immersion testing. Successful completion leads to promotion as a full Operative.

## 🧭 Rank vs. Role in the Field

Rank does not mean you always lead. SPECTRE encourages adaptability, humility, and trust:

- Operatives may take point under a Warfighter depending on mission structure.
- Leaders are responsible not just for decisions, but for listening, guiding, and learning.
- Everyone fights together — no role is beneath a Warfighter, and no job is too small for Command.

> Leadership is earned through consistency, trust, and execution — not just title.
