# Sustainment Planning for Leaders

A plan that ends after the first contact isn’t a plan — it’s a forecast for failure. Sustainment is how a unit keeps fighting after the initial assault, the first casualties, and the first resupply. Planning for logistics is not reactive — it’s proactive, and it starts before the operation begins.

This guide outlines how SPECTRE leaders incorporate logistics into every stage of their planning cycle.

## Why Logistics Belongs in the Plan

- Ammunition and medical supplies run out
- Vehicles break, casualties occur, teams get separated
- Operations often last longer than expected
- Plans that ignore sustainment break down under pressure

A good tactical plan is irrelevant if it cannot be executed beyond the first phase.

## Key Planning Elements

### 1. Ammo and Equipment

- Estimate how much ammo will be used per phase
- Plan for resupply or redistribution points
- Ensure critical assets (AT, demo, medical) are distributed, not clustered
- Include sustainment in the [briefing format](/sop/mission-planning/briefing-doctrine)

### 2. Medical and CASEVAC

- Identify who is carrying medical supplies
- Designate rally points that double as CCPs
- Plan for [CASEVAC triggers and procedures](/sop/logistics-and-sustainment/casevac)
- Include recovery options for casualties in both near and far contact

### 3. Phased Resupply

- Treat every phase line as a checkpoint for resupply
- Use [rally points](/sop/logistics-and-sustainment/rally-points) for pre-staged crates or redistribution
- Pre-assign fireteams or vehicles to logistics tasks if required
- Use [convoys](/sop/logistics-and-sustainment/convoy-procedures) or caches to deliver resupply during extended operations

### 4. Loadout Strategy

- Coordinate team loadouts to avoid redundant or over-specialized kits
- Assign one or two per fireteam to carry spares for the element (AT, smoke, batteries, extra mags)
- Rehearse resupply redistribution methods in training

## Leadership Integration

- Platoon and section leads should build sustainment **into the OPORD**, not after
- Use mission duration estimates and expected contact intensity to define logistics pacing
- Assign a 2IC or logistics contact to monitor supply reports
- Build logistics into your [OODA loop](/sop/leadership/frameworks) — reassess and adapt between phases

---

## Contingencies for Logistics Failure

- Identify a fallback supply location
- Pre-brief “soft abort” conditions if critical assets are lost
- Include recovery plans for disabled vehicles or lost equipment
- Train teams to redistribute internally when resupply fails

---

## Final Reminder

A well-supplied unit can adapt. A depleted one can only endure. Logistics is not just a support function — it is a combat multiplier. Leaders who plan to sustain are leaders who plan to win.
