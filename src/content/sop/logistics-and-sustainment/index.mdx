# Logistics & Sustainment

Operations do not succeed on tactics alone. They succeed when units are sustained, casualties are managed, and movement remains under control. Logistics is what keeps a mission moving after contact — or failing under its own weight.

This section provides guidance on how SPECTRE leaders and Warfighters manage the unseen parts of a mission: **supply, movement, recovery, and continuity**.

## Why This Matters

In any operation, no matter the size or scope:

- Ammo will run out
- People will go down
- Vehicles will break
- Plans will change
- Timing will slip

The difference between teams that adapt and teams that collapse is often their **logistical preparation**.

## Topics Covered

- **Resupply Procedures**  
  When, where, and how to keep your team supplied and ready.

- **CASEVAC and Field Medical**  
  How to manage injuries, movement of casualties, and stabilize the team.

- **Rally Points and Staging**  
  Using fallback positions, consolidation areas, and safe zones to maintain tempo.

- **Convoy Procedures**  
  How to stage, move, and secure vehicles in transit — including response to threats or breakdowns.

- **Vehicle Protocols & Embarkation**  
  Role assignment, mount/dismount discipline, and keeping vehicular operations under control.

- **Logistics Planning for Leaders**  
  Sustaining operations through foresight, resource management, and planning for endurance — not just the first engagement.

## Integration with SOP

This section supports and connects with:

- **Mission Planning** (especially resupply and CASEVAC planning)
- **Leadership** (delegating logistics, crisis fallback)
- **Movement and Tactics** (vehicle coordination, staging discipline)

## Final Note

Logistics is not glamorous — but it is mission-critical. In SPECTRE, leaders plan beyond the first contact. They plan to win **and** continue the fight.

Failure to sustain is failure to lead.
