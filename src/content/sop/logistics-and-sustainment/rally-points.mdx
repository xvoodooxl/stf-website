# Rally Points & Staging

Rally points are predesignated positions where teams regroup, hold, or transition between phases of an operation. They are foundational tools for maintaining control, enabling recovery, and adapting under pressure.

In SPECTRE, rally points are not optional — they are how disciplined units prevent disorder when things go wrong.

---

## Why Rally Points Matter

- Create predictable fallback options for contingencies
- Enable safe resupply or [CASEVAC](/sop/logistics-and-sustainment/casevac)
- Regroup scattered elements during contact or after a phase break
- Support transitions between [mission phases](/sop/mission-planning/timing-and-sync)
- Provide leaders with a point of control without over-managing movement

---

## Types of Rally Points

### 1. Pre-Mission Rally

Used during initial staging:

- Loadout checks and mission prep
- Final coordination before step-off
- Synchronization of timing across elements ([see: Timing & Synchronization](/sop/mission-planning/timing-and-sync))

### 2. Mid-Mission Rally

Used after phase transitions:

- Post-objective regroup
- Resupply and ACE reporting ([see: Resupply Procedures](/sop/logistics-and-sustainment/resupply-basics))
- Pause for [reassessment or replanning](/sop/leadership/planning-process)

### 3. Emergency Rally

Used when plans fail:

- Pre-briefed fallback location in case of leadership loss or comms failure
- Supports [Contingency Planning](/sop/mission-planning/contingencies-and-backups) and crisis leadership decisions

---

## Placement Guidelines

- Defensible terrain, ideally not exposed to open flanks
- Cover and concealment preferred over height or speed
- Avoid predictable paths (e.g., main roads or chokepoints)
- Far enough from the AO to be safe, close enough to return to the fight quickly

---

## Naming Convention

- Keep it short and standard: "RP ALPHA", "Hold 1", "Fallback Red"
- Avoid inside jokes or unclear callouts — [Clarity is Command](/sop/communications/verbal-communication)
- Consistent naming allows cross-element coordination, especially in [multi-section ops](/sop/communications/advanced-coordination/multi-section-comms)

---

## Marking and Communication

- Mark on the map using shared tools or reference terrain
- Confirm rally points during the [briefing process](/sop/mission-planning/briefing-doctrine)
- Communicate their establishment and use clearly on radio
- Use visual markers, smoke, or other signals if radio is lost ([see: Comms Failure Protocols](/sop/communications/advanced-coordination/comms-failure))

## Final Reminder

Rally points allow units to regroup under pressure, restore order, and continue the mission. When properly briefed and used, they reduce confusion and give leaders room to lead.

> If your team doesn’t know where to go when things fall apart — they won’t go anywhere.
