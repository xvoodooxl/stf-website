# CASEVAC & Field Medical

Casualty evacuation is more than a medical action — it’s a leadership decision that affects tempo, morale, and survivability. Whether your platform has advanced medical mechanics or basic health systems, CASEVAC must be part of every plan.

This document outlines the principles for treating, moving, and recovering wounded Warfighters in the field.

---

## CASEVAC vs MEDEVAC

- **CASEVAC** – Tactical evacuation using available combat resources (on foot, by vehicle, etc.)
- **MEDEVAC** – Dedicated medical extraction asset with protected status (rare in most game scenarios)

SPECTRE uses **CASEVAC** as the standard model.

---

## Core Principles

- Prioritize **survival and team cohesion** over heroics
- Plan for **collection, treatment, and movement** before contact
- Use **safe zones** and **rally points** for regroup and stabilization
- Assign responsibility — don’t assume “someone” will handle it

---

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Team Lead** – Decides when to hold, treat, or evacuate
- **2IC or Designated Medic** – Provides triage or manages casualty movement
- **Fireteam Members** – Provide security, assist with carry, or manage equipment handoff

Even in platforms with no formal medic system, assign these responsibilities clearly.

---

## CASEVAC Flow

1. **Contact Identified** – Warfighter is wounded or downed
2. **Secure the Area** – Establish security before attempting movement or aid
3. **Triage** – Determine if casualty can fight, needs extraction, or is unconscious
4. **Evacuate or Hold** – Move to Rally Point or fallback if needed
5. **Reintegrate** – If recovered, assign back into element or hand off to command

---

## Collection Points

Pre-brief **Collection Points (CCPs)** where injured can be staged:

- Choose terrain with cover and concealment
- Pair with rally points when possible
- Assign overwatch or security team
- Mark location visually or verbally when relevant

---

## When to Abort or Hold Position

Leaders must decide:

- Do we **continue the mission** with reduced strength?
- Do we **pull back and consolidate**?
- Can we **continue with one element covering while others recover**?

The wrong decision costs more casualties than the original contact.

---

## Integration with Mission Planning

Every operation should define:

- Location of CCPs or fallback zones
- Who carries medical gear
- Protocol for unconscious or downed teammates
- Contingency for losing your only medic or casualty carrier

## Final Thought

In SPECTRE, leaving someone behind isn’t just a failure of execution — it’s a failure of planning. Build CASEVAC into your brief, assign responsibility, and prepare your team to respond with calm and control.

> Getting shot is chaos. Evacuating shouldn't be.
