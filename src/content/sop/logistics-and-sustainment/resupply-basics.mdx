# Resupply Procedures

Resupply is not something that happens when it’s convenient — it’s something that should be **anticipated, triggered, and integrated** into every plan.

Whether your platform has advanced logistics mechanics or only basic resource tracking, the same principle applies: a team that fails to plan for sustainment will run out of options when it matters most.

---

## Core Principles

- **Resupply should be planned, not reactive**
- **Every team should know when, where, and how they’ll rearm**
- **Leaders are responsible for enabling resupply, not requesting it when it’s too late**

---

## When to Resupply

Resupply should be triggered by **predefined conditions**, not improvised mid-contact.

Common triggers include:

- Phase transitions (“resupply before breaching Bravo”)
- Casualty thresholds or ammo depletion (“50% or lower combat effectiveness”)
- Post-objective consolidation
- At designated rally or hold points

Avoid resupplying during high-risk moments unless explicitly planned.

## Resupply Planning in Briefings

During mission planning or leadership briefs, ensure:

- There is a **primary resupply point** (initial cache, vehicle, delivery point)
- A **backup method** is identified (redistribution, fallback stash)
- Teams know who is responsible for **initiating** resupply
- Timelines and movement phases account for supply pauses

## Loadout Discipline

Every team member has a role to play in sustainment:

- Carry **spare ammo or medical supplies** for the team, not just yourself
- Fireteam leads should verify loadouts are balanced — avoid one-point failure in key equipment
- Teams should know who has what (e.g., who’s carrying the spare AT, demo, or smoke)

---

## Redistribution Under Fire

If dedicated resupply isn't possible:

- Leaders should manage **internal redistribution** of ammo or gear
- Prioritize based on weapon criticality (e.g., machine gunners, breachers)
- Brief fireteams on how to redistribute efficiently and safely

---

## Logistical Communication

Use simple calls or reports to manage resupply status:

- “Green” – fully stocked
- “Yellow” – can continue, but monitor
- “Red” – critical shortage, needs resupply
- “Black” – out of key resource (AT, medical, etc.)

This status should be relayed up during ACE reports or section check-ins.

## Integration with Rally Points

When possible, **pair rally points with planned resupply**:

- Use them as safe spaces for regrouping and rearming
- Pre-stock or roleplay caches as needed based on platform capabilities

---

## Final Thought

Resupply doesn’t just keep you in the fight — it gives you **options**. A fully supplied team can maneuver, hold, or breach with confidence. An under-supplied team is one mistake from collapse.

> Don’t just plan the fight — plan to finish it.
