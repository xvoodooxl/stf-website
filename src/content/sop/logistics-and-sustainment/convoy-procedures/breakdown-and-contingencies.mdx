# Breakdowns and Contingency Planning

Convoys rarely fail due to contact alone — they fail when unexpected problems aren't planned for. A single breakdown, wrong turn, or lost vehicle can stall an entire element or split teams at the worst possible time.

This document outlines how SPECTRE prepares for and manages the inevitable: things going wrong.

## Categories of Contingency

SPECTRE convoy planning considers the following types of failure:

- **Vehicle disablement or immobilization**
- **Route blockage or unpassable terrain**
- **Comms failure or loss of contact**
- **Loss of convoy leadership**
- **Unit isolation or splitting**

All of these can be mitigated — but only if they're expected and briefed ahead of time.

## Vehicle Breakdowns

- If a vehicle becomes inoperable, **report immediately** on Platoon Net
- Convoy halts only if planned or safe — otherwise, **continue and pull security at next rally**
- Determine if repair is possible or if vehicle must be abandoned
- Critical gear should be redistributed quickly if abandoning

**Dismount only when necessary and safe.** The team should know who assists and who covers.

---

## Blocked or Compromised Routes

- Lead vehicle calls out any obstacle or ambush trigger
- Do not attempt to bypass without direction unless briefed
- If rerouting, **communicate clearly and regroup at phase line or rally point**
- Maintain spacing during bypass to avoid congestion

> A blocked road is not a failed mission — unless leadership hesitates or the column stalls.

---

## Lost Comms

- Use pre-briefed fallback procedures if contact with convoy lead is lost
- Slow to visual tracking speed and regroup
- Use visual signals or predetermined map markers to maintain route
- Rally at pre-identified points if communication cannot be re-established

> See: [Comms Failure Protocols](/sop/communications/advanced-coordination/comms-failure-protocols)

## Leadership Loss or Disruption

If convoy lead is downed, disconnected, or otherwise unavailable:

1. Immediate next vehicle or assigned 2IC assumes control
2. Reconfirm status and regroup at safe location or rally
3. Pass updated leadership to Platoon Net and continue
4. Use [Crisis Leadership](/sop/leadership/crisis-leadership) principles to maintain momentum

> A good convoy doesn’t fall apart when the lead goes down — it adapts and rolls forward.

---

## Isolation and Separation

If the convoy becomes split due to terrain, contact, or confusion:

- Each element should proceed to the next planned rally point
- Report your position if possible — otherwise, hold position and await regroup
- Avoid reverse movement unless explicitly ordered — it creates collisions and crossfire risk
- Maintain full security even while isolated

---

## Final Note

Convoy success is not just about making it to the destination — it's about **handling the disruptions along the way** without losing the mission. SPECTRE convoys prepare for contact, but they lead through failure.

> The question is never if something will go wrong — only whether you’ve prepared your team to respond.
