description: How to organize personnel, assign roles, and prepare a convoy before movement begins.

# Staging and Preparation

The most critical moment in any convoy is before it starts moving. Proper staging ensures that every team, vehicle, and lead knows their role, their position in the order of movement, and the purpose of the movement itself.

This prevents delays, confusion, and security breakdowns once wheels are in motion.

---

## Objectives of Staging

- Assign vehicle roles and responsibilities
- Confirm vehicle order and spacing plans
- Load personnel and supplies into correct vehicles
- Conduct final checks and coordination
- Ensure every lead understands movement phases and contingencies

---

## Convoy Briefing Elements

Before departure, convoy leads should cover:

- **Order of movement** (who leads, who follows, who supports)
- **Vehicle designations** (e.g., Alpha-1, Logistics-2, Rear Security)
- **Primary route and fallback route**
- **Expected contact or hazard points**
- **Rally points, hold points, or dismount zones**
- **Comms plan** (lead channel, internal vehicle comms, cross-vehicle signals)

## Role Assignment

Every vehicle should have clearly assigned roles:

- **Driver** – Responsible for navigation, spacing, and maintaining convoy pace
- **Vehicle Commander (VC)** – Usually the senior person; manages radio, relays orders, handles navigation if not driving
- **Gunner (if applicable)** – Provides 360-degree awareness and covers assigned arcs
- **Passengers** – Responsible for dismount prep, internal security, and task loadout

Avoid redundant roles — every person in a vehicle should have a defined responsibility.

---

## Load Discipline

- Place teams in vehicles based on task or dismount grouping
- Keep fireteams together when possible
- Distribute critical gear (e.g., AT, medical, demo) across multiple vehicles
- Brief each vehicle on what they are carrying and who they’re responsible for moving

---

## Staging Considerations

- Use covered or concealed areas when possible
- Avoid choke points or high-ground exposure during loading
- Use visible or verbal confirmation when each vehicle is ready
- Final call should come from the convoy lead, not individual vehicle commanders

---

## Final Pre-Movement Checklist

Before stepping off:

- All vehicles identified and marked
- All radios checked and on net
- Movement order confirmed and briefed
- Rally points and emergency breakoffs understood
- All personnel briefed and mounted

> A convoy that launches uncoordinated will operate uncoordinated.

## Final Note

Staging is not downtime — it is structured, deliberate preparation. A good leader treats the pre-movement phase with the same seriousness as the fight ahead.

> Fail to prep, and you'll spend the first kilometer recovering from your own start.
