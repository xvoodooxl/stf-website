# Convoy Security and Threat Response

Convoys are vulnerable by nature — long, exposed, and often predictable. Security is not just about firepower — it’s about posture, awareness, and spacing that allow the unit to respond without chaos.

This guide outlines how SPECTRE maintains convoy security across all stages of movement.

---

## Security Principles

1. **Every vehicle has a role in security** — whether armed or not
2. Security must be active throughout movement — not only during contact
3. The lead and rear vehicles are especially critical to convoy protection
4. Contact response should be automatic, coordinated, and pre-briefed

---

## Vehicle Security Roles

| Position            | Primary Responsibilities                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lead (Point)**    | Detect threats, call contact, avoid overexposing the column    |
| **Middle Vehicles** | Maintain spacing, provide sector awareness, support flanks     |
| **Rear Security**   | Cover rear approach, serve as emergency break or casualty evac |

If the platform allows turrets or gunners, assign 360-degree arcs of fire across vehicles.

---

## Threat Detection

- Drivers and gunners must actively scan terrain and route
- Look for chokepoints, obstacles, blocked roads, or signs of IED placement
- Use comms to **report, not speculate** — "Possible obstacle front. Investigating."
- Lead vehicle should have clearance to halt without creating a pile-up

---

## Contact Response

When contact is made:

- **Do not stop blindly.** Maintain spacing, move through or halt as briefed
- **Return fire only if safe to do so.** Avoid fratricide or blocking convoy routes
- **If disabled:** Report quickly, dismount only with cover, and establish security
- **If not in contact:** Cover sectors and await orders

Dismount only if necessary — keep the convoy mobile unless deliberately engaging.

## Ambush Reaction Considerations

| Ambush Type              | Recommended Action                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Near ambush**          | Push through if possible. Return fire only if cover is close.      |
| **Far ambush**           | Suppress from mounted positions. Hold movement or maneuver flanks. |
| **IED or blocked route** | Halt at distance. Scan, reroute, or dismount if necessary.         |

If vehicles are split or isolated, regroup at a [rally point](/sop/logistics-and-sustainment/rally-points).

---

## Mounted vs Dismounted Security

- Gunners or open-position passengers cover 360 security
- Dismounts should not begin without purpose — cover, casualty aid, or blocking
- Maintain internal accountability — who is in, who is out, and why
- Assign overwatch roles for halts or holds if prolonged

---

## Security During Halts

- Gunners or VCs must continue scanning
- Stagger vehicles for fields of fire if possible
- Do not group around disabled vehicles unless covered
- Keep the lead and rear vehicles independently maneuverable

---

## Final Thought

Security doesn’t begin when the shooting starts — it begins when the vehicles roll. A convoy that trains for threat response can take contact and keep moving. One that reacts with panic becomes a target.

> Contact doesn’t break a convoy — disorganization does.
