# Convoy Procedures

Convoy operations are more than just driving from one point to another — they are coordinated, disciplined movements that carry personnel, supplies, or mission-critical assets through contested or unknown terrain.

Whether moving a single squad or multiple vehicles across multiple sections, convoy discipline is critical to maintaining tempo, security, and operational readiness.

## Purpose of Convoy Doctrine

- Move personnel and equipment efficiently and safely
- Maintain control and spacing across long movements
- Establish security before, during, and after transit
- Enable rapid response to breakdowns, threats, or route changes
- Keep units together and synchronized without over-communicating

Convoy operations support not only logistics — but tactical freedom of movement.

## Topics Covered in This Section

This section breaks down the key components of safe, effective convoy operations:

- **[Staging and Preparation](/sop/logistics-and-sustainment/convoy-procedures/staging-and-prep)**  
  Assigning vehicles, loading teams, confirming roles and orders.

- **[Movement Discipline and Spacing](/sop/logistics-and-sustainment/convoy-procedures/movement-discipline)**  
  Maintaining tempo, spacing, and visibility without micromanaging.

- **[Communications and Signals](/sop/logistics-and-sustainment/convoy-procedures/comms-and-signals)**  
  Radio nets, silent signals, and standard callouts for vehicle movement.

- **[Convoy Security and Threat Response](/sop/logistics-and-sustainment/convoy-procedures/security)**  
  Mounted security posture, fields of fire, and response to ambush or IED threats.

- **[Breakdowns and Contingency Planning](/sop/logistics-and-sustainment/convoy-procedures/breakdown-and-contingencies)**  
  Handling mechanical issues, vehicle losses, reroutes, or isolation.

## Final Note

Convoys fail when discipline breaks — not when enemies appear. SPECTRE trains convoy operations the same way we train combat: with intent, structure, and clear expectations.

> Movement is not safety. Controlled movement is.
