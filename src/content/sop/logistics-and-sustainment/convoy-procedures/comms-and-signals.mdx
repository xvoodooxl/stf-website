# Communications and Signals

In a convoy, communication must be clear, brief, and disciplined. Convoys often span multiple vehicles, cross complex terrain, and rely on rapid callouts for safety and cohesion. Maintaining radio clarity is essential to avoiding confusion and minimizing vulnerability.

This guide outlines how SPECTRE elements coordinate convoys using structured comms and simple, universal signals.

---

## Net Structure

SPECTRE operations standardize communications into **two primary radio nets**:

- **Platoon Net** – Used for coordination across elements (vehicle movement, multi-section communication)
- **Section Net** – Reserved for internal fireteam or squad communication

**Convoy operations use Platoon Net.**  
All vehicles must have a designated operator (usually the Vehicle Commander) monitoring Platoon Net throughout the movement.

---

## Role of the Vehicle Commander (VC)

- Monitors Platoon Net
- Issues callouts to the convoy or upstream to command
- Manages internal status (passenger readiness, spacing, etc.)
- Serves as the primary communicator for their vehicle — only one VC per vehicle should be transmitting on Platoon Net unless overridden by emergency

## Core Callouts (Platoon Net)

| Type             | Format / Example                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Step-off         | "Convoy, rolling out on Route Echo."             |
| Spacing check    | "Alpha-2, tighten spacing. Alpha-3 is trailing." |
| Halt             | "All vehicles hold. Obstruction ahead."          |
| Resume movement  | "Continue movement. Maintain spacing."           |
| Directional turn | "Vehicle One, right turn."                       |
| Threat report    | "Contact left. Alpha-1 returning fire."          |
| Reroute          | "Convoy rerouting to Alternate Route Bravo."     |
| Breakdown        | "Alpha-3 disabled. Establish security."          |
| Emergency stop   | "All vehicles emergency halt. Do not move."      |

Use **clear, minimal phrasing** and keep transmissions short. Over-communicating increases confusion, especially under pressure or in limited-comms environments.

## Non-Verbal Signals

Where supported by platform or training, use visual signals as supplements or backups to radio:

- **Brake tap** – Reduce speed
- **Hazards** – Prepare for full stop
- **Left/right indicator or light pulse** – Prepare for turn
- **Short horn burst** – Attention or follow delay
- **Hand signals** (if turret/hatch visible) – Backups for basic coordination

---

## Maintaining Comms Discipline

- All non-critical communication should be kept off Platoon Net
- Use clear vehicle identifiers (e.g., “Alpha-2,” “Logistics-1,” “Rear Security”)
- Avoid long-winded messages, unclear terminology, or radio overuse
- Confirm orders and status reports concisely: “Alpha-1, copy,” “Holding,” “Ready to roll”

If you lose comms, switch to [fallback procedures](/sop/logistics-and-sustainment/convoy-procedures/breakdown-and-contingencies) and regroup based on pre-briefed rally points.

---

## Silent Movement and Pre-Briefed Protocols

In stealth or degraded-comms conditions:

- Use timed movement, phase lines, or visual check-ins to sync
- Limit spacing to maintain visual contact
- Use terrain and movement markers in lieu of verbal callouts
- Only call out critical updates (contact, split, breakdown)

## Final Reminder

Radio traffic should guide the convoy — not flood it. During vehicle movement, **brevity, clarity, and purpose** are your best tools.

> A convoy is only as responsive as its comms are clear.
