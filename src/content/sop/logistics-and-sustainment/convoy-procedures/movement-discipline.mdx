# Movement Discipline and Spacing

A convoy's strength lies in its coordination. Without movement discipline, spacing collapses, vehicles drift out of position, and security fails under pressure. Movement should always be **deliberate, structured, and predictable**.

This guide explains how to manage pacing, spacing, line of sight, and formation using principles that mirror SPECTRE's [fireteam formations doctrine](/sop/movement-tactics/section-maneuvers/fireteam-formations).

## The Point Concept in Convoys

The first vehicle in the convoy serves as the **Point** — applying the same doctrine used in dismounted fireteam formations:

- **Moves ahead of the main body**, with deliberate spacing behind it
- **Detects threats, obstacles, or route issues early**, but is not a reconnaissance or scout element
- **Has reaction space** — it must be able to halt or fall back without risking the rest of the convoy
- **Should not be the convoy lead vehicle** if the convoy commander is present — leadership should maintain a global view, not absorb first contact

> This creates a buffer for reaction and maneuver, maintaining convoy survivability even under unexpected contact.

## Spacing Guidelines

Spacing is variable based on terrain and threat level:

- In open terrain, increase spacing to reduce vulnerability to explosives or ambush
- In tight or urban terrain, reduce spacing while maintaining line of sight
- Avoid stacking vehicles in line of fire or around corners
- Ensure the Point has extra spacing to fall back if contact is made

If the Point vehicle is compromised or hit, other vehicles must have room to stop or maneuver immediately.

## Maintaining Order

- **Drivers** manage vehicle spacing and maintain visual contact
- **Vehicle Commanders** monitor rear and call out gaps or collapses
- **Convoy Lead** should confirm the status of the Point and adjust speed accordingly
- If a vehicle falls out of line, the convoy should **pause and regroup**, not stretch out

---

## Halts and Stops

All halts should be:

- **Disciplined** – Maintain security and spacing
- **Covered** – Provide 360-degree observation
- **Communicated** – Use radio or hand signals to relay cause and duration
- **Quick** – Unless preplanned, long halts reduce control and invite contact

The Point should never be the cause of a halt without calling it out. If halted for recon or route check, they must communicate immediately.

---

## Line of Sight Management

- Vehicles must maintain either **visual or radio contact** at all times
- Do not overtake the Point unless ordered — this disrupts convoy hierarchy
- If line of sight is broken due to terrain, use phase lines or hold points to regroup

---

## Deconflicting Movement

- Confirm formation health regularly
- Use staggered vehicle speeds for terrain or weight differences
- Assign overwatch or rear security vehicles depending on convoy length
- Adjust for exposure zones — especially for the Point, which is most likely to absorb ambush or IED threats

---

## Adapting to Terrain

- Forested terrain: Tighten spacing, lower speed, Point should reduce visibility and watch for ambush
- Urban areas: Point should check intersections and call holds for exposed turns
- Hills and ridgelines: Avoid skylining; give the Point time to check ahead and assess exposure

## Final Note

Convoy discipline isn't just about movement — it's about **survivability, communication, and trust** between vehicles. Applying the Point Concept keeps the lead vehicle purposeful, and the rest of the convoy reactive — not panicked.

> A convoy without a Point is blind. A Point without space is a casualty waiting to happen.
