# Vehicle Protocols & Embarkation

Vehicles offer mobility, cover, and transport, but they also introduce risk. Poor embarkation discipline can stall operations, break formations, and expose teams to unnecessary danger.

This SOP outlines how SPECTRE units manage vehicle usage with control and coordination — ensuring transitions into and out of vehicles are as efficient as the movements they support.

---

## Core Principles

- Mount and dismount with **clear intent and control**
- Every vehicle has assigned roles and responsibilities
- Use **timed, deliberate transitions** — not chaos at the door
- Never treat vehicles as neutral spaces — they are always part of the tactical picture

---

## Pre-Mount Checks

Before any embarkation:

- Confirm vehicle assignments and roles (driver, VC, passengers)
- Verify radios and call signs are active and confirmed
- Load all necessary equipment or personnel
- Receive a final movement order or objective briefing

Only the convoy lead or designated team leader should authorize movement once all vehicles are staged.

## Role Assignment Inside the Vehicle

| Role                       | Responsibility                                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Driver**                 | Manages spacing, speed, and safety during movement         |
| **Vehicle Commander (VC)** | Communicates with command or convoy net; directs dismount  |
| **Gunner / Overwatch**     | Maintains security arc or observation during travel        |
| **Passengers**             | Prepare for dismount, monitor surroundings, assist on call |

Unassigned passengers should always default to security or equipment readiness.

## Embarkation Procedure

1. **Cover the vehicle before approach** — no blind rushing
2. **Mount in teams** or as assigned, one vehicle at a time
3. **Confirm status** with VC or fireteam lead once all inside
4. **Report “All mounted”** up the chain if in a lead role
5. Convoy lead gives “Move” call once all vehicles are loaded

---

## Dismount Procedure

Dismounting should be **structured and pre-briefed**:

- Use verbal or radio cue from VC or team lead
- Avoid all dismounting on the same side unless cover exists
- **First out covers**, **last out clears** — keep arcs active
- Use buddy pairs or fireteams to fan out and secure surroundings
- Re-establish team spacing and orientation immediately

In contact:

- Prioritize cover over formation
- Only dismount if the vehicle is no longer a viable position
- Use bounding dismounts or suppressive fire as needed

## Mount/Dismount Discipline

- Never abandon your assigned vehicle unless ordered or incapacitated
- Avoid cross-traffic during mounting or exiting
- Use internal comms or short callouts: “Clear left,” “Mounting,” “Two out rear”

If platform allows, close doors and hatches to reduce detection and maintain immersion.

---

## Emergency Exits and Isolation

If dismounted early or separated from your team:

- Identify the nearest friendly vehicle or rally point
- Do not re-mount without clearance
- Hold position and report if isolated
- Rejoin at the next hold or dismount point

---

## Final Note

Embarkation is not downtime. Vehicles are part of your formation and your mission. How you enter and exit them reflects your control, your discipline, and your readiness.

> The moment you lose structure inside the vehicle — you’ve already lost the fight outside it.
