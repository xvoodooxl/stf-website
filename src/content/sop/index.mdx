# Standard Operating Procedures (S.O.P.)

Welcome to the official SOP of the **SPECTRE Task Force**. This is a living document detailing the policies, procedures, and tactical systems that define how we train, deploy, and fight. It is the result of real-world doctrine adapted to fit the unique demands of immersive military simulation across games like *Ground Branch*, *Arma Reforger*, and *Arma 3*.

This site serves both as a **training reference** and an **operational standard** for all SPECTRE Warfighters.

## Core Pillars

All members of SPECTRE are expected to uphold our three foundational principles:

- **Discipline** – We put aside ego and prioritize performance, clarity, and cohesion.
- **Brotherhood** – We fight for the team before ourselves. No one gets left behind.
- **Desire to Improve** – We reflect, review, and refine. Progress is part of the mission.

## Advisory

This SOP is designed solely for video game simulation. It is not intended for real-world combat training and should not be used as such. SPECTRE doctrine is customized for our unit, and may differ significantly from real-world equivalents or other gaming groups. All members train under the same doctrine so we can operate effectively as a unit.

---

## Combat Mindset

These operating fundamentals form the mental framework behind all actions in the field:

1. **Shared Doctrine** – Every Warfighter trains to the same SOP so we can slot into any element, any time, with full confidence and interoperability.
2. **Tactical Awareness** – Stay alert, observe your team and terrain, and always anticipate the next move.
3. **Controlled Aggression** – We act decisively but never recklessly. We take initiative only when supported by cover, comms, and clarity.
4. **Consistency Under Pressure** – SOPs are built to be repeatable, reliable, and effective—even under fire.
5. **Self-Discipline** – Your team depends on you. Your actions, comms, and decisions matter every moment.

## Engagement Philosophy

- **Surprise. Speed. Violence of Action.**  
  When we strike, we strike hard and with purpose.
- **Cover. Coordination. Communication.**  
  We don’t move blindly. Every action is synchronized and supported.
- **Fight Smart. Lead Boldly. Operate with Precision.**  
  Leadership is a mindset, not a rank.

## The SPECTRE Experience

SPECTRE operations are dynamic, immersive, and shaped by the creativity of our community. Through custom scenarios, high-stakes missions, and innovative uses of platform mechanics, we push tactical play to its limits.

Expect:
- Civilian Injection and Covert Operations
- HVT Interdiction and Dynamic Enemy QRF
- Custom Objectives and Indirect Fire
- Unexpected threats like VBIEDs, pilot failures, and bomb timers

These operations are where doctrine meets adaptation—your training is what turns chaos into success.

## Commitment & Conduct

We believe in excellence without pressure. There are no mandatory attendance requirements. What we expect is that when you're here, you're **focused, respectful, and working to improve**.

> **“Life comes first. But when you’re on mission, your team comes first.”**

Refer to the [Community Structure](/sop/community-structure) and [Community Guidelines](/sop/community-guidelines) to understand how we support our members and hold each other accountable.

## Continue Learning

The rest of the SOP will walk you through everything you need to know—from how to move, communicate, plan, lead, and adapt in the field.

> **Train hard. Lead well. Fight smart.**

# Standard Operating Procedures (S.O.P.)

This website is a collection of all policies, procedures, and tactics used by the SPECTRE Task Force, and subsequently SPECTRE Warfighters as a whole. This resource serves as a guide, and should be referenced when training. This is a living document and is updated regularly.

While the tactics and methods described in this document are publicly available, the methods in which these tactics are curated and employed is specific to the SPECTRE Task Force.

This S.O.P. is culmination of real-world military experience and knowledge from operators around the globe. It is the product of hundreds of hours of careful curation and application to what we do as a group. It is also constantly changing as the platforms we use to operate continue to evolve. One reading may have questions or require clarification; using an appropriate channel in our discord to inquire about our doctrine and its applications is highly encouraged.

## Advisory

These S.O.P. are not directly purposed for real-world use, nor does it constitute as a substantive replacement of real-world combat training. As such, SPECTRE does not condone any use of these manuals for any purpose outside of military simulation within video gaming platforms. Additionally, doctrines displayed are curated specifically for SPECTRE, and may not match what others have trained on their own, as all units have separate doctrine. As a unit with a focus on special warfare operations, it is likely that those experienced in infantry tactics and the like will find some discrepancies between these manuals and common doctrine, which is expected. We all train the same doctrine so we can all fight the same way, and Warfighters should work to learn with these tactics, not against them.

# OPERATING FUNDAMENTALS

These concepts and practices are the baseline for anybody operating within our community. They mainly include techniques and practices surrounding the safe and basic operation of a fireteam - Mastery of these techniques will come through experience and habitual repetition. */}

{/* ## What is SPECTRE?
// TODO: This is duplicated in the main page and should be moved to somewhere else also

SPECTRE is a wargaming community with a passion for operational competence through the use of tactics drawn from real-world military doctrine. We train to execute conflict-driven, narratively connected operations with a focus on immersion and variety in scope and objective. In short, SPECTRE is a military simulation group that strives to do MORE. The community is the product of years of development, thousands of hours of collective experience between our leadership, and learning from our mistakes. Through these things, SPECTRE as a whole strives to produce a unique, immersive military simulation experience.

## What are SPECTRE core values?

SPECTRE, in an effort to cultivate a culture that inspires leaders and encourages personal growth, stands by three core pillars that you need to know:

1. **Discipline**:
   All of our members strive to be skilled professionals, and are willing to put aside ego to achieve that.

2. **Brotherhood**:
   Everyone in SPECTRE is a brother or sister with the rest - we all fight for each other before ALL else.

3. **Desire to Improve**:
   All of us are constantly seeking to improve through self-reflection and analysis, and take pride in self-accountability.

## What commitment does SPECTRE require?

SPECTRE and its leaders all stand by the notion that LIFE COMES FIRST. Nothing here means anything if it detracts from the human experience, and we do not have explicit activity requirements for that reason. All we ask is that as a SPECTRE Warfighter, you strive to embody our core pillars, and continue to grow as a player and a person whenever possible. We believe that this creates an environment where the community experience is measured in quality in time, not quantity.

## What to expect in SPECTRE?

SPECTRE has a long-standing tradition of furthering the possibilities of its game platforms. In the case of Ground Branch, SPECTRE’s main game, many of our leaders have pioneered new methods of gameplay through utilizing the game’s systems that other communities have not. Some examples of this that we pride ourselves on are Civilian Injection (Covert Operation), HVT Operations, Indirect Fire and Close Air Support, Custom Operational Objectives, Comprehensive Overwatch (Clearing Map Boundaries), and Dynamic Operational Changes (Enemy QRF, Bomb Threats, VBIED Placement, Pilot Failures, Mortar Interception, etc.).
All of these unique possibilities created by our technically savvy members, combined with a narratively cohesive experience, creates a level of immersion and interest that lasts. */}
