# Standard Operating Procedures (S.O.P.)

Welcome to the official SOP of the **SPECTRE Task Force**. This is a living document detailing the policies, procedures, and tactical systems that define how we train, deploy, and fight. It is the result of real-world doctrine adapted to fit the unique demands of immersive military simulation across games like _Ground Branch_, _Arma Reforger_, and _Arma 3_.

This site serves as both a **training reference** and an **operational standard** for all SPECTRE Warfighters.

> While not required, it is **highly recommended** that all members read the entire SOP to fully understand how we operate. If you want to get started quickly, refer to the [Academy](/academy) section — especially **Basic Training** — to begin learning the fundamentals.

## Core Pillars

All members of SPECTRE are expected to uphold our three foundational principles:

- **Discipline** – We put aside ego and prioritize performance, clarity, and cohesion.
- **Brotherhood** – We fight for the team before ourselves. No one gets left behind.
- **Desire to Improve** – We reflect, review, and refine. Progress is part of the mission.

## Advisory

This SOP is designed solely for video game simulation. It is not intended for real-world combat training and should not be used as such. SPECTRE doctrine is customized for our unit and may differ significantly from real-world equivalents or other gaming groups. All members train under the same doctrine to operate effectively as a unit.

## Combat Mindset

These operating fundamentals form the mental framework behind every action in the field:

1. **Shared Doctrine** – Every Warfighter trains to the same SOP to enable full interoperability.
2. **Tactical Awareness** – Stay alert, observe terrain and teammates, and anticipate next moves.
3. **Controlled Aggression** – Act decisively, but never recklessly. Use initiative with cover, comms, and clarity.
4. **Consistency Under Pressure** – SOPs are built to be reliable and effective—even under fire.
5. **Self-Discipline** – Your team depends on you. Every action, callout, and movement matters.

## Engagement Philosophy

- **Surprise. Speed. Violence of Action.**  
  Strike hard and with purpose.
- **Cover. Coordination. Communication.**  
  Move only when supported and synchronized.
- **Fight Smart. Lead Boldly. Operate with Precision.**  
  Leadership is a mindset—not a rank.

## The SPECTRE Experience

SPECTRE operations are dynamic, immersive, and shaped by the creativity of our community. Through custom scenarios, high-stakes missions, and innovative platform use, we push tactical gameplay to its limits.

Expect:

- Civilian insertion and covert operations
- HVT interdiction and dynamic enemy QRF
- Custom objectives and indirect fire support
- Unpredictable threats: VBIEDs, pilot failures, bomb timers

These operations are where doctrine meets adaptation. Your training is what turns chaos into success.

## Commitment & Conduct

We believe in excellence through discipline—not pressure. There are no mandatory attendance requirements. What we expect is that when you're here, you're **focused, respectful, and working to improve**.

> "Life comes first. But when you're on mission, your team comes first."

Refer to the [Community Structure](/sop/community-structure) and [Community Guidelines](/sop/community-guidelines) to understand how we support our members and hold each other accountable.

## Continue Learning

The rest of the SOP will guide you through everything you need to know—from how to move, communicate, plan, lead, and adapt in the field.

> **Train hard. Lead well. Fight smart.**
