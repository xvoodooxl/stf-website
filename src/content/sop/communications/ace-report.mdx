# ACE Report
An ACE Report is a brief summary of an element's status, and stands for Ammunition, Casualties, and Equipment. This report is given using the traffic light system, shown below:

- **GREEN**: You are above 80% of your max - Fully effective.
- **YELLOW** or **AMBER**: You are around 50% of your max - Still effective to continue.
- **RED**: You are below about 20% of your max - May not be able to continue without resupply.
- **BLACK**: You are out, at 0% of your max - Cannot continue on mission and desperately need to resupply.

Each section of the ACE Report should be given its own status. An example is shown below.

A fireteam lead communicates with his team and realizes that they have enough ammunition to proceed, they have lost one man out of four, and have the charges that need to be planted on the chopper. They now get the following call from the squad lead:

**`“Bravo, 0-1, ACE report.”`**

The fireteam lead replies:

**`“0-1,1-4, Bravo is GREEN on ammo, YELLOW on men, and GREEN on charges. Bravo is ready for further orders.”`**

The squad lead is comfortable letting Bravo continue on mission, so says:

**`“Bravo, 0-1, Charlie Mike.”`**
*C.M = Continue Mission*

Bravo lead my reply:

**`“0-1, 1-4, Wilco, Oscar Mike.”`**
*O.M = On the Move*

Additionally, it should be noted that whether an element is still effective or not is decided by the team lead (or whoever is in their place otherwise).
