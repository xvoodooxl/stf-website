# Radio Communication
Radio communication is a vital to relay information from one element to another. Because of this, there are radio etiquette guidelines to ensure that the radio communication is concise, accurate, and understandable.

To begin a transfer communication with another element of person, you should state their element/callsign, and then your own element/ callsign, followed with a confirmation of connection, like so:

> An easy way to remeber this is "Hey you, this is me, [message]".

**`“SPECTRE Actual, 0-4, how copy?”`**

If read loud and clear, they will respond indicating that they are receiving your transmission:

**`"0-4, Good Copy.”`**

From here, a transfer of communication has started, and does not end until either element ends a transmission with “out.”, in which that transmission is finished.

Below are a list of words and their meanings in the context of radio communication:

- **`“How Copy?”`** - Requests acknowledgement of radio transfer and contents of transfer, if applicable.
- **`“Lima Charlie” / “Loud and Clear” / “Good Copy”`** - Acknowledges clear radio transfer.
- **`“Say again?”`** - Requests a repeat of transfer. Do *NOT* use “Repeat”, which refers to artillery.
- **`“Affim” / “Good Copy”`** - Acknowledges and confirms traffic
- **`“Wilco”`** - Will comply, specifically used to confirm the following of orders
- **`“Break break break”`** - Holds radio comms, used in an emergency
- **`“Break”`** - Pausing transmission, used when transmitting a large amount of information to allow other stations to speak up if they need to.
- **`“Standby”`** - Is used to advise another party to wait on a response
- **`“Standing By”`** - used to acknowledge a “standby” call
- **`“Wait _ / Hold _“`** - Pauses radio comms, typically specified in minutes. (e.g. “Wait One.”)
- **`“Over”`** - Passes the transfer to another party
- **`“Out”`** - Ends the radio transfer
