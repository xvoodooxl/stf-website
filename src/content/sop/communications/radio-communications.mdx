# Radio Communications

## Purpose

Radio communication enables sections and platoon-level units to maintain real-time coordination across the battlefield. A disciplined and structured radio protocol ensures that essential information is delivered clearly, quickly, and with minimal risk of confusion, even under fire.

## Definition

Radio communications are verbal transmissions sent across designated frequencies or voice channels to relay orders, situational updates, and coordination messages. Depending on the mission or game engine, a dual-net setup is preferred:

- **Platoon Net**: Used for communication between Section Leaders, Platoon Leadership, and Command Section.
- **Section Net**: Used internally within each Section for Fire Team coordination.

> Not all games or missions support multi-net configurations. In those cases, radio discipline becomes even more critical.

## Key Principles

- Use “[listener], this is [speaker]” format to initiate communication.
- Speak **clearly, slowly, and with intent**.
- Keep transmissions **brief and essential**.
- Follow **closed-loop communication** procedures to confirm orders and acknowledgements.
- Avoid **crosstalk or overlapping transmissions** — only one person should speak at a time.
- Prioritize Platoon Net for inter-section reports and Section Net for local execution.

## Application

### 🔁 Standard Radio Flow

1. **Initiating Call**:

   > `“Alpha, Bravo, how copy?, over.”`

2. **Acknowledgment**:

   > `“Bravo, Alpha, good copy, over.”`

3. **Transmission Content**:

   > `“Move to grid 1234, over.”`

4. **Confirmation**:

   > `“Move to grid 1234, copy, over.”`

5. **Close Transmission**:
   > `“Good copy, out.”`

💡 _Remember: “Over” means you're passing the mic. “Out” means the conversation is done._

### 🔁 Closed-Loop Communications

Used to **confirm orders**, **repeat critical data**, and **verify understanding**:

1. Sender issues command
2. Receiver repeats back
3. Sender confirms or corrects

> **“Bravo, Alpha. Cover the south window.”**  
> **“Alpha, Bravo. Covering south window, over.”**  
> **“Bravo, Alpha. Good copy, out.”**

### 📖 Radio Verbiage Reference

| Phrase                                          | Meaning                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **"How Copy?"**                                 | Requests confirmation that message was received.    |
| **"Good Copy / Loud and Clear / Lima Charlie"** | Message received clearly.                           |
| **"Say Again?"**                                | Request repetition of message (never say “repeat”). |
| **"Wilco"**                                     | Will comply.                                        |
| **"Break Break Break"**                         | Emergency priority message incoming.                |
| **"Break"**                                     | Pause in long message.                              |
| **"Standby"**                                   | Wait for more information.                          |
| **"Standing By"**                               | Acknowledging the request to wait.                  |
| **"Wait One"**                                  | Short pause (usually one minute).                   |
| **"Over"**                                      | End of your turn; awaiting response.                |
| **"Out"**                                       | Transmission complete.                              |

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Talking too quickly or without clear structure.
- ❌ Using casual language or inside jokes.
- ❌ Forgetting to identify both parties in multi-unit environments.
- ❌ Flooding the Platoon Net with irrelevant chatter.
- ❌ Saying “Repeat” instead of “Say Again.” (Repeat = fire mission).

## Summary

Proper radio procedure is one of the most important skills in the SPECTRE SOP. Whether you're a fireteam member passing a contact report, a section leader coordinating a breach, or a platoon lead issuing tasking orders, clear radio comms enable rapid, reliable decision-making.
