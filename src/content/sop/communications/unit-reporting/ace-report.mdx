# ACE Report

## Purpose

The ACE Report provides a quick and standardized way for fireteam and section leaders to communicate their element's operational effectiveness. It covers **Ammunition**, **Casualties**, and **Equipment**, and is critical for assessing whether a team is capable of continuing a mission or needs support.

## Definition

An ACE Report is a short transmission, typically over the radio or during a verbal handoff, that summarizes the team‚Äôs combat readiness using a simplified color code system:

- **Ammunition** ‚Äì Ability to engage in continued combat.
- **Casualties** ‚Äì Number of effective members still operating.
- **Equipment** ‚Äì Mission-critical gear such as explosives, breaching tools, etc.

SPECTRE uses a **color-coded system** for brevity:

- üü¢ **GREEN** ‚Äì Fully effective. No critical shortages.
- üü° **YELLOW** ‚Äì Some degradation (e.g., one magazine low, light injury, minor missing equipment), but still mission-capable.
- üî¥ **RED** ‚Äì Limited capability. Serious degradation requiring attention. Team may not be reliable without resupply or reinforcement.
- ‚ö´ **BLACK** ‚Äì No longer combat effective. Out of ammo, mission gear, or too few members to continue.

> ‚ùó ACE colors are not based on exact percentages or numerical thresholds. They rely on the team leader‚Äôs judgment to provide a realistic and immediate assessment of their team's combat effectiveness.

## Key Principles

- Use ACE to **summarize team status**, not detail every item.
- The section/team lead determines the appropriate color for the whole team.
- Should be requested after major engagements or before committing to new objectives.
- Reports flow **from Fireteam ‚ûù Section Leader ‚ûù Platoon**.
- If multiple colors apply, use the lowest effective status (e.g., 2 Green areas and 1 Red = Report Red).

## Application

A standard ACE exchange typically takes place between the Platoon Lead and a Section Leader. The Section Lead gathers status from both fireteams and provides a consolidated summary of their section's combat effectiveness:

**Platoon Net**

> `"Bravo, Alpha, ACE report, over."`

**Section Lead responds**

> `"Alpha, Bravo. Bravo is Yellow. Standing by for orders, over."`

**Platoon Lead replies**

> `"Bravo, Alpha. Copy. Hold position and await resupply, out."`

In this example, the section is still able to fight, but not at peak effectiveness. The decision to resupply or press on is made by the receiving commander.

## Common Mistakes

- ‚ùå Reporting separate colors for each category unless explicitly asked.
- ‚ùå Using numbers or over-detailed explanations (e.g., ‚Äú2 mags, 1 KIA, 1 demo charge left‚Äù).
- ‚ùå Under-reporting critical shortages due to optimism or poor judgment.
- ‚ùå Omitting ACE reports when they're requested or operationally necessary.

## Summary

The ACE Report is a simple but powerful tool for maintaining situational awareness across a unit. By focusing on a clear, color-coded summary, teams reduce radio clutter and speed up command decision-making. Trust your team leads to call it accurately‚Äîand act quickly when a report signals that support is needed.
