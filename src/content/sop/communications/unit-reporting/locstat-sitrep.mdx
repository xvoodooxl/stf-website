# LOCSTAT and SITREP

## Purpose

LOCSTAT and SITREP reports allow section and platoon leaders to maintain situational awareness of friendly elements across the battlespace. These formats provide clear, concise updates on **where units are** and **what they are doing**, enabling better coordination, support, and deconfliction.

## Definition

- A **LOCSTAT** (Location Status) provides a unit‚Äôs **current and future position**.
- A **SITREP** (Situation Report) provides a unit‚Äôs **current location, activity, intent, and needs**.

Both formats are typically delivered by **Section Leaders** to the **Platoon Leader or Command Section** over the Platoon Net.

## Key Principles

- LOCSTATs are used primarily for **navigation and movement tracking**.
- SITREPs are used to convey **actions, observations, and future intent**.
- Reports should follow a consistent format for clarity.
- Only include relevant and actionable information ‚Äî avoid clutter.

## Application

### üîπ LOCSTAT Format

Used to report unit position and movement:

1. Who is reporting
2. Unit composition (how many)
3. Current location (relative or grid-based)
4. Intended destination or movement

**Example:**

> _"Actual, Bravo lead plus four is currently static approximately 130 meters west of target building. We‚Äôre beginning our approach towards the target building, moving directly East at this time. How copy? Over."_

### üîπ SITREP Format

Used to provide a more comprehensive update:

1. Who is reporting
2. Unit composition (how many)
3. Current location (relative or grid-based)
4. Current activity (e.g., engaging, holding, observing)
5. Next intended action
6. Any support or assistance required

**Example:**

> _"Actual, Bravo lead plus four is currently 60 meters west of rally point. Working to get eyes on potential ambush groups southwest of our position. We‚Äôll be moving south to secure the western flank before rendezvousing. Requesting overwatch from any element able to support during the approach. How copy? Over."_

## Common Mistakes

- ‚ùå Mixing SITREP and LOCSTAT formats without structure
- ‚ùå Overloading with unnecessary detail (e.g., terrain descriptions, exact bearing if not relevant)
- ‚ùå Forgetting to include next movement or intent in SITREPs
- ‚ùå Failing to specify unit size or who is speaking
- ‚ùå Using jargon or unclear terms that could lead to misinterpretation

## Summary

LOCSTAT and SITREP are fundamental tools for operational coordination. LOCSTAT helps track team movement, while SITREP gives commanders a real-time picture of unit activity and needs. Keeping these reports short, structured, and relevant improves battlefield flow and decision-making.
