# Unit Reporting

Communication isnâ€™t just about talking â€” itâ€™s about **reporting relevant information in the right way, at the right time**. Unit Reporting protocols provide concise formats for relaying situational, positional, and readiness information up and down the chain of command.

Each of these tools exists to minimize confusion, reduce radio traffic, and ensure the team leader, squad leader, and command elements are kept informed.
