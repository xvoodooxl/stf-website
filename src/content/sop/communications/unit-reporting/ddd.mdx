# ADDRAC and aDDD

## Purpose

ADDRAC and its abbreviated form, aDDD, are immediate contact report formats used to quickly and clearly inform your team or section about enemy presence, location, and engagement intent. They are designed to minimize hesitation and confusion during initial contact, especially when time is limited.

## Definition

- **aDDD** stands for **Alert, Direction, Distance, Description** — a simplified and fast verbal contact call used by default in most SPECTRE operations.
- **ADDRAC** stands for **Alert, Direction, Description, Range, Assignment, Control** — a more detailed format used when there is time and need to communicate specific instructions to fireteams or elements.

These formats ensure that all relevant information is relayed **in the first few seconds of contact** so teams can react swiftly and appropriately.

## Key Principles

- Always start with an **ALERT** to get everyone’s attention.
- Prioritize **DIRECTION and DESCRIPTION** for situational awareness.
- Use **aDDD** in nearly all engagements — it's the standard under pressure.
- Reports should flow from **Fire Team to Section Lead**, then up to **Platoon Net** if needed.

## Application

### 🔹 aDDD Format (Standard)

This is the standard call used by all fireteam members:

- **Alert** – “Contact!”
- **Direction** – “East!”
- **Distance** – “30 meters!”
- **Description** – “Two armed!”

**Example:**

> _“Contact, East, 30 meters, two armed!”_

Short, fast, and effective — especially over Section Net or in verbal-only conditions.

### 🔹 Full ADDRAC Format

ADDRAC is a more comprehensive reporting format that includes additional command elements such as task assignment and fire control. While it is not typically used in the fast pace of contact, it may be useful when there is time to plan or coordinate a structured engagement.

- **Alert** – Initial attention cue (e.g., "Contact!")
- **Direction** – Cardinal or relative (e.g., "Northwest", "12 o'clock")
- **Description** – Target identity and type (e.g., "Two-man patrol")
- **Range** – Estimated distance (e.g., "50 meters")
- **Assignment/Method** – Who should engage and how (e.g., "Red team flank right")
- **Control** – When to engage (e.g., "Wait for my shot")

**Example:**

> _“Contact, South-Southeast, 3-man patrol, 40 meters, Blue Team flank right, hold until I fire.”_

While aDDD is generally faster and easier to use under pressure, ADDRAC provides more context and direction when time and clarity allow.

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Skipping the **Alert**, leaving teammates unaware a report is starting
- ❌ Giving vague direction (e.g., “Over there!”)
- ❌ Neglecting range, which affects immediate tactical decisions
- ❌ Issuing control commands without clarity on who is being tasked (ADDRAC only)

## Summary

aDDD is the standard format for SPECTRE contact reports — fast, repeatable, and well-suited for Section-level combat. Its simplicity ensures rapid understanding under stress. ADDRAC, while less commonly used, remains valuable for situations where detailed coordination is required. Understanding both formats ensures flexibility across different mission demands.
