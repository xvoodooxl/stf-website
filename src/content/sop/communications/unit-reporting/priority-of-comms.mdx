# Priority of Communications

## Purpose

Clear prioritization of communications ensures that critical information is transmitted without delay and that unnecessary chatter does not interfere with command and control. Understanding what should be said first ‚Äî and what can wait ‚Äî is essential for maintaining battlefield cohesion and safety.

## Definition

Priority of Communications refers to the practice of determining **what type of message** has the right to interrupt or take precedence over ongoing radio traffic. It ensures that urgent or mission-critical information is heard immediately.

## Key Principles

- Urgent safety-critical messages always take precedence.
- Contact reports override all non-emergency chatter.
- Higher headquarters (Platoon Command) has priority unless a contact report is underway.
- Non-urgent updates (e.g., minor location adjustments) should wait until the net is clear.
- Operators must listen before transmitting.

## Application

### üîπ Communication Priority Levels

1. **Emergency / Safety Critical**

   - Calls like "Break, Break, Break!" for emergencies (e.g., friendly down, friendly fire risk).
   - Immediate contact reports (e.g., "Contact, front!").

2. **Enemy Contact Reports**

   - First notification of enemy presence (ADDRAC or aDDD).

3. **Command Orders / Reassignments**

   - Instructions from Platoon Lead or Section Leaders.

4. **SITREPs / LOCSTATs / ACE Reports**

   - Status and positional reports once the situation is stable.

5. **Requests for Support**

   - Requests for medical, ammunition resupply, extraction, etc.

6. **Administrative Traffic**
   - Non-critical information, minor coordination, internal team notes.

### üîπ Handling Net Congestion

- If you must interrupt, use "Break, Break, Break" to immediately seize the net.
- Otherwise, wait for a natural transmission pause and key up quickly.
- Keep your initial message short, then expand details once control is established.

## Common Mistakes

- ‚ùå Talking over active enemy contact reports.
- ‚ùå Prioritizing low-level administrative chatter while tactical events are unfolding.
- ‚ùå Failing to listen before keying up.
- ‚ùå Waiting too long to send urgent safety reports.

## Summary

Prioritizing communication ensures that critical battlefield information is not lost in the chaos of operations. By respecting urgency levels, properly interrupting when necessary, and practicing disciplined radio usage, teams can maintain control and effectiveness even under pressure.
