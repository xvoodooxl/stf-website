# Comms Roles & Responsibilities

## Purpose

Defining communication roles ensures that each member of a fireteam, section, or platoon understands when and how they are expected to speak — and who they should be listening to. This promotes clarity, maintains radio discipline, and supports effective command and control during operations.

## Definition

Communication responsibilities are **role-specific expectations** regarding who initiates transmissions, who monitors which net, and how information flows up and down the chain of command.

## Key Principles

- Only the appropriate leader should speak on higher nets (Platoon Net).
- Each unit should maintain clear internal channels (Section Net).
- Lower-level units report **upward**, higher units issue **downward**.
- Everyone listens, but not everyone speaks — use your chain of command.

## Application

### 🔹 Fire Team Member

- Speak only on Section Net when:
  - Reporting immediate contact (e.g., aDDD format).
  - Responding directly to your Team Lead.
  - Alerting the team to urgent threats or movements.

### 🔹 Fire Team Leader

- Maintains internal communication with team members.
- Passes up ACE inputs and contact reports to Section Leader.
- May help manage team discipline over Section Net.

### 🔹 Section Leader

- Monitors both Section Net and Platoon Net.
- Passes upward:
  - ACE Reports (section-level)
  - Contact Reports
  - LOCSTATs / SITREPs
- Receives orders from Platoon Lead and distributes them to Fire Teams.

### 🔹 Platoon Leader

- Primary voice on Platoon Net.
- Issues taskings, redirects sections, coordinates support.
- Initiates SITREP/ACE calls as needed.

### 🔹 Optional Command Section Roles

If present:

- **RTO (Radio Operator)** may handle routine traffic on behalf of the Platoon Lead.
- **JTAC** communicates directly with CAS/IDF assets.
- **Intel/Recon** elements may report sightings directly to the Platoon Lead but usually not to general traffic.

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Fireteam members transmitting directly on Platoon Net.
- ❌ Multiple people trying to report the same thing (contact, SITREP).
- ❌ Not delegating comms duties (e.g., overwhelmed PL handling everything alone).
- ❌ Team Leaders forgetting to pass up reports from their team.

## Summary

Comms discipline is built on **knowing your role** and **respecting the chain of command**. By ensuring that each player only speaks when appropriate — and passes information through the proper channels — your unit becomes faster, quieter, and more combat effective.
