# Using Translations in the Field

## Purpose

Tactical operations often involve interacting with civilians or enemy forces who do not speak English. This guide provides practical tips for using multilingual phrases effectively in high-stress, time-sensitive situations without causing confusion or escalating threats.

## Definition

This article focuses on **how and when** to use translated phrases during gameplay — not just what to say. It supports immersive and safe multilingual interaction, especially when engaging unknown individuals or non-combatants.

## Key Principles

- Use short, clear, and rehearsed phrases only.
- Avoid improvising or over-speaking in unfamiliar languages.
- Nonverbal cues (gesture, posture) are just as important as verbal ones.
- Assign a player as the primary communicator when possible.

## Application

### 🔹 When to Use Translations

- During **civilian encounters** where intent must be conveyed non-aggressively.
- When ordering **enemy forces or suspects** to stop, surrender, or disarm.
- To de-escalate or gather basic information (e.g., identity, status).

### 🔹 Best Practices

- Brief your team on **which phrases** may be used before mission start.
- Stick to **essential commands** (e.g., “Stop!”, “Hands up!”, “We won’t hurt you.”).
- Reinforce translations with **hand signals** and **weapon posture** (low-ready or slung).
- Speak **slowly and clearly**, even if your pronunciation is off.
- Use **one speaker per team** to avoid confusion.

### 🔹 Combining Translations with Roleplay

- Have your translator open with the target’s language, then switch to English slowly.
- Use tone and body language to signal intent.
- Only escalate to force if clear instructions have been ignored.

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Multiple players shouting different things in different languages.
- ❌ Using untranslated or slang phrases.
- ❌ Speaking while aiming weapons directly at the subject.
- ❌ Assuming locals understand the intent without visual reinforcement.

## Summary

Using multilingual phrases adds realism, immersion, and tactical clarity — but only when applied carefully. By preparing ahead of time and relying on rehearsed phrases and deliberate behavior, teams can communicate effectively across language barriers while staying in control of the situation.
