# Nonverbal Communication

## Purpose

Nonverbal communication provides a silent alternative to verbal or radio communication, particularly during **stealth-based operations** or **when comms are compromised**. Using lasers, lights, and physical gestures allows fireteams and sections to maintain coordination without revealing their presence.

## Definition

Nonverbal communication includes signals made using visible or infrared lasers, flashlights, body language, or gestures to silently transmit intent, direction, and confirmation of actions.

These are especially critical in:

- Night operations (especially under NVGs)
- CQB environments
- Scenarios requiring radio silence or stealth
- Situations where verbal communication would cause confusion or compromise

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Available nonverbal signals may vary depending on the game or mission era. For example, **Arma Reforger**, set in the Cold War era, does not provide NVGs or IR lasers. In such cases, teams must adapt signals using visible light or physical gestures instead.

## Key Principles

{/* - All nonverbal signals must be **pre-briefed** during mission prep. */}

- Use tools consistently (e.g., lasers vs lights).
- **TL and 2IC should control signals** to reduce miscommunication.
- Requests made via nonverbal signals are assumed to be **understood and acted upon** unless explicitly denied.

## Application

### üîπ General Signals

- **Barrel Lift**: Raise barrel up-and-down ‚Üí ‚ÄúReady!‚Äù; buddy returns the motion to say ‚ÄúGo go go!‚Äù
- **Soft Contact** (unconfirmed): Circle/lasso with IR or visible laser on object
- **Hard Contact** (confirmed): Solid IR/visible laser on target
- **Action Confirmation**: Vertical laser ( | ) across object
- **Action Cancellation**: Horizontal laser ( ‚Äî ) across object

### üîπ Movement Signals

> _Use under NVGs or in dark interiors_

- **Pull Call / Last Man**: Blink IR light at individual until they pull. Once they move, shine IR laser briefly to avoid crossfire.
- **Stack Move**: Solid flashlight/IR light past point man (initiated by TL/2IC)
- **Direction of Travel**: Solid light pointing in desired direction. Turn off once most of the element is moving.

### üîπ Deployable Device Requests

#### Flashbangs

- **Request**: Two quick flashes (top of door)
- **Negative**: One solid flash (2 sec hold)

#### Fragmentation Grenades

- **Request**: Lasso/circle above door with laser
- **Negative**: Solid laser above door (2 sec hold)

#### Breaching Charges

- **Request**: Lasso/circle directly on door
- **Negative**: Solid laser on door (2 sec hold)

#### Confirmation / Cancel

- **Confirm**: Vertical laze ( | ) on door
- **Cancel**: Horizontal laze ( ‚Äî ) on door

> All CQB-specific signals covered here assume familiarity with IR/laser tool usage under NVGs. Other nonverbals specific to urban/CQB will be covered in that dedicated section.

## Common Mistakes

- ‚ùå Using nonverbal cues **inconsistently across team members**
- ‚ùå Misinterpreting silence as approval without a clear pre-briefed protocol
- ‚ùå Using laser in inappropriate environments (e.g., daytime or near civilians)
- ‚ùå Confusing signal types (e.g., mix-up between cancel and confirm)

## Summary

Nonverbal communication is a mission-critical skill when radio and verbal options aren‚Äôt viable. By training in signal clarity and discipline, teams can silently coordinate movements, initiate breaches, and maintain stealth in hostile environments.
