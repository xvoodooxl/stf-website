# Verbal Communication

## Purpose

Effective verbal communication allows fireteams, sections, and platoon leadership to share critical information quickly and with minimal confusion. Whether over radio or face-to-face, consistent terminology reduces misinterpretation, speeds up decision-making, and prevents friendly fire.

## Definition

Verbal communication refers to any spoken messages—either direct (face-to-face or within shouting distance) or transmitted over short-range voice channels (radio). This includes combat calls, orders, and response protocols used to maintain clarity during operations.

## Key Principles

- Always **use clear and concise terms** — avoid slang or overly casual phrasing.
- Speak **calmly under stress** — tone can communicate urgency or panic unintentionally.
- Ensure **radio brevity** — keep transmissions short and focused.
- Use **common terminology** — standardized phrases improve team-wide understanding.
- Practice **closed loop communication** when possible to confirm understanding.

## Application

The following terminology is standard across all SPECTRE operations:

### ✅ Common Combat Phrases

- **Contact** – Confirmed hostile visual.
- **Movement** – Unconfirmed movement, possibly enemy.
- **Audible** – Unconfirmed audio detection.
- **Shot** – Used when firing across friendlies’ lines of fire. All team members should pause momentarily.
- **Bail Bail Bail** – All members immediately break off current task and return to nearest hard cover, abandoning vehicles if necessary.

These terms are used **verbally**, whether face-to-face or over Section Net/Platoon Net (depending on your position).

### 🔐 Challenge and Pass (Verbal IFF)

Challenge and Pass is a verbal Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system used in close-quarters where team separation has occurred or non-uniformed friendlies may be present.

- **Challenge**: First word, used by the initiating party.
- **Pass**: Correct response that confirms friendly status.

Example:

> **"Raven?"** → **"Tac!"**

> 🔧 _Words should be mission-specific and rotated regularly._

### 🔄 Closed Loop Comms (Verbal Edition)

Used for confirming orders or status changes when not on radio:

> **TL:** “Cover the hallway left.”  
> **Operator:** “Covering hallway left.”

This feedback loop ensures clarity and helps avoid double-tasking or missed instructions.

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ **Using unclear language** under stress (e.g., “they’re over there!” instead of “Contact, East, 50 meters”).
- ❌ **Not using verbal IFF** in friendly-looking civ ops.
- ❌ **Talking over others** during active contact — prioritize brevity and hierarchy.
- ❌ **Giving conflicting commands** without clarifying who is in charge (especially between Fire Team and Section leaders).

## Summary

Verbal communication is the foundation of teamwork. In both Section Net and face-to-face exchanges, using clear terms and structured confirmation keeps all players synchronized and reduces the chance of mistakes. Practice is key to internalizing these phrases so that they become instinctive under pressure.
