# Battlefield Verbiage
Proper use of clear, concise terminology helps standardize communication, minimize confusion, and reduce the chances of friendly-fire incidents. All team members should be familiar with the following terms and their meanings:

- **Contact** - Confirmed hostile unit
- **Movement** - Visible presence, non-confirmed
- **Audible** - Audible presence, non-confirmed
- **Shot** - A team member hast to take a shot past friendlies. Everyone should pause for a moment. 
- **Bail Bail Bail** - Tells everyone that they should return to the closest piece of hard cover, abandoning any vehicle they might be in. 

## Challenge and Pass (Verbal IFF)
Challenge and Pass is a technique that uses a set of predetermined call words to confirm friendly presence in close quarters. When a friendly unit calls the challenge word, the other calls the pass word, similar to Marco Polo. Typically, these words are obfuscated between operations to prevent rolling intelligence with hostile groups encountered more than once.

- **Challenge** - The first word in the challenge and pass sequence. This is typically a word that is easy to remember, but not commonly used in conversation.
- **Pass** - The second word in the challenge and pass sequence. This is typically a word that is easy to remember, but not commonly used in conversation.

### Example:
- **Challenge** - **`"Raven?"`**
- **Pass** - **`"Tac!"`**
