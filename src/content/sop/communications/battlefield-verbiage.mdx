## Challenge and Pass
Challenge and Pass is a technique that uses a set of predetermined call words to confirm friendly presence in close quarters. When a friendly unit calls the challenge word, the other calls the pass word, similar to Marco Polo. Typically, these words are obfuscated between operations to prevent rolling intelligence with hostile groups encountered more than once.
