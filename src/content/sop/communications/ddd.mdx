# ADDRAC
An ADDRAC is an immediate description of persons or objects of interest with the purpose of alerting one’s element. Additionally note that direction, description, and range are interchangeable in order and do not require a specific sequence. An ADDRAC includes the following:

- **ALERT**: The initial alert, which primes other units to prepare.
- **DIRECTION**: The direction a target is in. Can be skipped if target is singular and obvious.
- **DESCRIPTION**: In short words, a description of the target(s)
- **RANGE**: The range between the reporting element and the target, or relevance to a location.
- **ASSIGNMENT/METHOD**: Only used if the need to shift sectors or method of engagement arises.
- **CONTROL/COMMAND**: Used to tell you when to start placing fire on a target.

An example ADDRAC communication is as follows:

**`“Patrol of 2 armed to the South-Southeast, 30 meters out, moving back to front. 0-4, keep eyes on the right man but wait to engage until my mark. Let them approach.” [-After engagement is favorable-] “Take the shot 0-4.”`**

## aDDD
An abreviated version of an ADDRAC is the aDDD (also called the three Ds). In which,

- **a - alert**
- **D - Direction**
- **D - Distance**
- **D - Description**

is called out in that order. This is to ensure that the team pays attention to at least the direction of threat in case of radio failure (***your demise***).

An example of an aDDD communication is as follows:

**`“Contact, East, 40 meters, two man patrol”`**
