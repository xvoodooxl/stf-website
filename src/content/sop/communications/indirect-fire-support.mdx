# Indirect Fire Support and CAS
SPECTRE uses a simplified but effective “5-Line Briefing” call for Fire Support and Close Air Support.
Whenever an Aircraft or Indirect Fire Support team receives a Line Brief from an JTAC (Observer), they must use [close loop communications](/sop/communications/radio-communications#closed-loop-communications) and repeat back the same line that the observer called. This is to minimize BLUE ON BLUE incidents and ensure that Fire is properly delivered to the enemy. 

To effectively call in a fire mission either by IDF or CAS, the following procedures should be used:

1. **JTAC (Joint Terminal Attack Controller) calls in the fire mission**:

`[Aircraft or Mortar Team callsign] this is [JTAC callsign], fire mission, fire mission, over.`

2. **Aircraft or Mortar Team callsign acknowledges the call**:

`[Observer or JTAC callsign] this is [Aircraft or Mortar Team callsign], good copy, over.`

3. **JTAC provides friendly unit's location / mark**:

`Friendlies located at [Grid], marked by [Beacon, Smoke, Strobe, etc] over.`

4. **JTAC provides target location**:

`Target location [Grid / Compass bearing / range(meters) / TRP, etc] over.`

5. **JTAC provides target description (optional)**:

`Target description [target description], marked by [IR pointer, Tracers, Smoke] over.`

6. **JTAC gives order for fire mission**:

`[Fire mission] [Fire for effect] [Number of rounds] [Type of round] [Fire pattern] [Danger close] over.`

7. **Aircraft or Mortar Team acknowledges the order**:

`[JTAC callsign] this is [Aircraft or Mortar Team callsign], good copy, [repeats fire mission], firing for effect, out.`

8. **JTAC provides BDA (optional)**:

`[Aircraft or Mortar Team callsign] this is [JTAC callsign], [effect on target], [repeat], over.`

### EXTRAS/AS REQUIRED:
For IDF, marking of a target may not be necessary, but a Target Description may be, so as to aid in BDA calls.
For closer fires [within 200 meters], the Observer/Commander must accept responsibility for increased risk of friendly fire and give the order to fire. This is called **Danger Close**.

## Example of a CAS Fire Mission:

1. **JTAC:** **`"Bravo, this is Alpha, fire mission, fire mission, over."`**
2. **Aircraft:** **`"Alpha, this is Bravo, good copy, over."`**
3. **JTAC:** **`"Friendlies located at grid 123456, marked by smoke, over."`**
2. **Aircraft:** **`"Fiendlies located at grid 123456, over."`**
4. **JTAC:** **`"Target location grid 654321, over."`**
2. **Aircraft:** **`"Target Location grid 654321, over."`**
5. **JTAC:** **`"Target description: enemy infantry, marked by IR pointer, over."`**
2. **Aircraft:** **`"Enemy infantry, marked by IR Pointer, over."`**
6. **JTAC:** **`"Fire mission, fire for effect, 8 rounds high explosive, west to east, danger close, over."`**
7. **Aircraft:** **`"Alpha, this is Bravo, good copy, 8 rounds high explosive, west to east, danger close, firing for effect, out."`**
8. **JTAC:** **`"Bravo, this is Alpha, good effect on target, out."`**
