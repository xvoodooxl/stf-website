# Indirect Fire Support
Through the use of moderator and administrator permissions in Ground Branch, SPECTRE simulates indirect fire via mortar team. In order to call on a mortar team for indirect fire, use the following communication:

**`“Fire mission, fire mission, [Grid square or squares], [Fire pattern if applicable], [round count and type], [Additional information], fire for effect.”`**

At this point, after rounds impact, you may either confirm hits with “Good Effect on Target” after a Battle Damage Assesment (BDA), or ask for a second set of fire by saying  **`“Mortar Team, Repeat”`**

EXAMPLE:

**`“Fire mission, fire mission, grid kilo 6 to lima 6, west to east, 8 rounds high explosive, danger close, fire for effect!”`** 

-Rounds impact-

**`“Mortar team, Repeat!”`**

-Rounds impact- 

**`“Good effect on target!”`**
