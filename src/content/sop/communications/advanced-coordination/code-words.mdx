# Code Words and Encryption

## Purpose

Code words and verbal encryption help protect operational security by obscuring sensitive information from enemy listeners or unintentional leaks over the radio. Even in casual or semi-realistic operations, a basic layer of information control improves survivability and mission success.

## Definition

**Code words** are pre-arranged substitutes for sensitive terms (locations, actions, units, or timings).

**Encryption techniques** refer to deliberate methods of making communications harder to interpret without full context ‚Äî without requiring complex electronic encryption.

## Key Principles

- Use simple, memorable code words.
- Everyone in the element must know the current code words before stepping off.
- Change codes between missions when possible.
- Be cautious of overcomplicating; clarity is still critical inside the team.

## Application

### üîπ Example Code Word Categories

| Real Concept       | Example Code Word |
| :----------------- | :---------------- |
| Rally Point        | "Home Base"       |
| Extraction Vehicle | "Package"         |
| Explosives Ready   | "Gifts Wrapped"   |
| Breach Initiation  | "Knock Knock"     |
| Target Building    | "Hotel"           |
| Medic Needed       | "Ice Cream Man"   |
| Go Signal          | "Green Light"     |

### üîπ Basic Verbal Encryption Techniques

- Refer to directions relatively ("move toward the beacon" instead of "move east").
- Avoid transmitting specific grid coordinates unless absolutely necessary.
- Use code colors or names for sensitive elements (e.g., "Bravo Actual" instead of "Lieutenant Smith").
- Delay exact mission terms until on secure ground or secure channels.

### üîπ Radio Example

**Instead of:**

> "Bravo, push east 300 meters to the red building and prepare breach."

**Use:**

> "Bravo, move toward Home Base and get ready to Knock Knock."

> ‚ö° Simplicity is key: if the code word is too complicated, it will slow down real-time operations.

## Common Mistakes

- ‚ùå Using random, forgettable code words without briefing.
- ‚ùå Forgetting to brief or rehearse code words before stepping off.
- ‚ùå Speaking openly about sensitive details over unsecured radio.
- ‚ùå Over-encrypting and confusing your own team.

## Summary

Lightweight code word usage offers a practical balance between security and operational tempo. When combined with disciplined radio practices and pre-mission briefings, it ensures that critical information is protected without sacrificing speed or clarity.
