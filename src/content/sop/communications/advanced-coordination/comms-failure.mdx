# Comms Failure Protocols

## Purpose

When radio or verbal communication fails, units must still be able to operate effectively. These protocols provide fallback plans for maintaining cohesion, continuing the mission, and avoiding friendly fire in the absence of clear communication.

## Definition

Comms failure protocols are **pre-established behaviors and contingencies** that dictate what units should do if communications are lost — whether due to equipment failure, distance, interference, or suppression.

## Key Principles

- Every unit must have **a fallback plan** before stepping off.
- Units must be trained to operate semi-independently under commander's intent.
- Re-establishing comms should be attempted regularly, but not at the cost of safety or mission progress.

## Application

### 🔹 Standard Contingencies

1. **Lost Radio Contact (Temporary):**

   - Attempt to move to a higher position or known signal zone.
   - Retry at regular intervals.
   - Use nonverbal signals to communicate status or intent within your element.

2. **Lost Contact with Other Element (Platoon/Section):**

   - Continue toward last known objective unless countermanded.
   - Link up at a pre-briefed rally point or fallback grid.
   - Avoid deviating from assigned lane or sector.

3. **Full Section Comms Blackout:**

   - Follow the most recent valid order.
   - Maintain visual cohesion within your fireteam.
   - Move to regroup position if applicable.

4. **Rally Points & Timing:**
   - All major operations should include at least one **pre-designated rally point**.
   - If isolated, wait **5 minutes at RP** before proceeding or exfiltrating.

### 🔹 Alternate Communication Methods

- **IR/Visible Lasers or Lights** (for movement and attention)
- **Gunshots or Deliberate Noise** (last resort only — high risk of confusion)
- **Timed Actions** (e.g., breach at 30-second mark if no signal given)

> ❗In situations where full comms failure occurs, leadership should emphasize unit autonomy and mission intent during pre-brief.

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Panicking and abandoning objectives too early.
- ❌ Attempting to move across friendly sectors without identification.
- ❌ Remaining static indefinitely without fallback timing.
- ❌ Attempting to shout or talk when stealth is required.

## Summary

Comms will fail — it's part of operating in complex scenarios. What matters is how well your unit is prepared to respond. With clear pre-briefs, fallback rally points, and an understanding of the commander's intent, even a silent team can still accomplish its mission.
