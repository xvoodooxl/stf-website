# Multi-Section Communications

## Purpose

When multiple sections are operating under a single platoon or task force, effective inter-section communication ensures synchronized movement, prevents friendly fire, and supports unified execution. This article provides guidelines for how to manage communication across multiple sections or elements during joint operations.

## Definition

Multi-Section communications refer to **inter-element coordination** involving two or more sections operating simultaneously. These are typically managed over the **Platoon Net**, while internal coordination remains on each **Section Net**.

## Key Principles

- Only **Section Leaders** or their designated **2ICs** communicate on the **Platoon Net**.
- Fireteam members and subordinate elements maintain silence on the Platoon Net.
- **Platoon Lead** manages movement timing, synchronization, and overall objectives.
- **Deconfliction** of movement, fire arcs, and responsibilities is handled via Section Leaders.

## Application

### üîπ Basic Net Structure

- **Section Net**: Each section handles internal comms (fireteams, tactical coordination).
- **Platoon Net**: Section leaders (or 2ICs when delegated) report status, request support, and receive orders.

### üîπ Section Leadership Structure

Each section consists of two fireteams:

- One led by the **Section Leader**.
- One led by the **Second in Command (2IC)**, who functions as the section's sergeant.

The 2IC is responsible for:

- Leading the second fireteam.
- Managing the section when split.
- Assisting in relaying and executing section-level orders.
- Taking over comms if the Section Leader is busy or incapacitated.

### üîπ Key Responsibilities

- **Platoon Lead**:

  - Issues movement and task orders.
  - Requests status (SITREP, LOCSTAT, ACE) from sections.
  - Approves or redirects requests for fire support, breaching, resupply, etc.

- **Section Leader**:

  - Relays reports (e.g., ACE, SITREP) upward.
  - Passes Platoon Lead‚Äôs orders down to fireteams.
  - Coordinates cross-section maneuvers (e.g., bounding, flanking).

- **2IC (Second in Command)**:
  - Leads one of the section's fireteams.
  - Assists with section-level comms and task execution.
  - Temporarily steps into Section Lead‚Äôs role when needed.

### üîπ Techniques for Cross-Section Coordination

- Use **precise locations** when referring to enemy/friendly positions (e.g., TRP, grids).
- Establish **temporary taskings** (e.g., ‚ÄúBravo covers east flank while Alpha breaches‚Äù).
- When in proximity, consider **visual markers** or **nonverbal signals** for coordination.
- Use **short callsigns** and maintain brevity when multiple sections are active.

> ‚ùó Always confirm when another section is entering your AO (Area of Operations).

## Common Mistakes

- ‚ùå Fireteam members transmitting on Platoon Net.
- ‚ùå Sections moving independently without notifying Platoon Lead.
- ‚ùå Multiple sections engaging without clear lane separation or coordination.
- ‚ùå Cross-talk or long-winded messages that slow down the net.

## Summary

In multi-section operations, disciplined and streamlined communication is critical. By keeping Platoon Net clear, adhering to the chain of command, and clearly reporting movements and needs, sections can operate independently without losing cohesion as a single fighting force.
