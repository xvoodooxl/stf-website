# Hammer and Anvil
Fire and Maneuver (also known as Hammer and Anvil) is a multi-element technique in which one element acts as a suppressant, and uses effective fire to keep a target stationary and ineffective. A second element uses this suppression to flank the enemy and engage with overwhelming ferocity.

One such maneuver is the four Fâ€™s:

1. Find - Locate the enemy
2. Fix - Pin them down with suppressing fire
3. Flank - Send soldiers to the enemy's sides or rear
4. Finish - Eliminate all enemy combatants
