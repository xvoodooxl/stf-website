# 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before any mission, every operative is responsible for ensuring they’re fully prepared — physically, tactically, and technically. This checklist helps reduce last-minute confusion, gear issues, and comms failures that could compromise the mission.

> This checklist follows the **Shoot → Move → Communicate** logic and is tailored to each supported game. Use it as a mental run-through or fireteam-wide verification step before stepping off.

---

## 💡 How to Use This

- Review the checklist relevant to your game in the tabs below
- Confirm all items based on your assigned **combat role**
- Adjust as needed for mission-specific instructions
- Use buddy checks: your teammate’s gear is your concern too

> 🔗 Loadout details and platform-specific gear rules are defined in the [Equipment Regulations](/equipment-regulations) section  
> 🎖️ Role expectations and responsibilities are defined in the [Combat Roles](/sop/operational-structure/combat-roles) SOP

## 🧠 General Notes

- **Role awareness is key**: each checklist assumes you've confirmed your assignment (e.g., Rifleman, AR, Medic).
- **Cross-check your buddy**: make sure your team is squared away, not just yourself.
- **Vehicle readiness is shared responsibility**: fuel, ammo, repair, and seating all matter.
- **Practice comms before combat**: it's too late to test mics when bullets fly.

🟢 _“Prepping before the mission is how you win during it.”_
