# Telegraphing
Telegraphing is accidentally revealing our own presence or location to others. There are a few different forms of telegraphing, shown below:

- **Physical**: Involves the protrusion of physical objects, such as muzzles or feet.
- **Light/Laser**: Involves “triggering” the room with a light or laser device.
- **Lightlining**: Involves light sources “outlining” or revealing your figure in the dark.
- **Skylining**: Similar to Lightlining, except involves a person’s body or kit contrasting the sky behind them. Common on hills or crests.
