# Cover vs Concealment
Hard cover is round-stopping cover, while concealment is only visual cover. Whether something constitutes as Hard Cover or not depends on its size, stability, and the caliber of round being placed through it. Different materials can handle different rounds, and should be considered.

## Fighting From Cover/Concealment
When fighting from cover, you should be aware of the following:
- **Cover**: Use hard cover to protect yourself from enemy fire. This includes walls, vehicles, and other solid objects that can stop bullets. Don't let yourself be seen by anyone but the enemy you're shooting at.
- **Concealment**: Use concealment to hide your position from the enemy. This includes bushes, trees, and other objects that can block the enemy's line of sight. Smoke can also be used to conceal your position dynamically.
- **Movement**: Move quickly and quietly from cover to cover. Avoid exposing yourself to enemy fire while moving.
- **Shooting**: When shooting from cover, use the cover to protect yourself from enemy fire. This includes leaning out from behind cover to shoot.

## Smoke
Use smoke to obscure the line of sight for both offensive and defensive situations, including CQB. 
Hurl smoke toward known or suspected enemy locations, forcing them to lose visual contact. 

If the enemyâ€™s exact position is unclear, drop smoke at or near your own location to mask movement and reduce detection. 

When hostile forces deploy smoke, deliver suppressive fire into the concealed areas and limit their ability to maneuver freely. 

Keep in mind that smoke amplifies uncertainty around enemy positions and may require additional caution.
