# Fireteam Roles

Given limitations in equipment provided to operators in Ground Branch, Warfighter fireteams often do not follow fireteam convention, instead equipping operators with multi-role platforms. By default, a Warfighter fireteam is solely composed of riflemen; Fireteam leaders, if the operation permits, may designate any of their team members as Auto Rifleman or Designated Marksman.
