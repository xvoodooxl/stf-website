# Fireteam Roles

Given limitations in equipment provided to operators in Ground Branch, Warfighter fireteams often do not follow fireteam convention, instead equipping operators with multi-role platforms. By default, a Warfighter fireteam is solely composed of riflemen; Fireteam leaders, if the operation permits, may designate any of their team members as Auto Rifleman or Designated Marksman.

*Equipment regulations can be found here: [SPECTRE Warfighter Equipment Guide](../equipment-regulations.mdx)*

## Team/Squad leader
Armed with a multi-role platform, the team leader is responsible for coordinating with other fireteams and squads, and ensuring that all members are following the rules of engagement.
