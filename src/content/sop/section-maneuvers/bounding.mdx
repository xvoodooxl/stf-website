# Bounding
Bounding is a technique used to move in a chosen direction while not compromising security. It is performed by having one or more unit(s) hold security of a hostile area while another unit(s) rushes to a further point of hard cover. Once set, the responsibilities will switch, and those initially holding security will then rush forward as well. There are two types of bounding, shown below:

<div className="pt-4 w-full flex flex-row flex-wrap">
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center flex-1">
        <h1 className="pb-4">Succesive Bounding</h1>
        <Image  src="/bounding-succesive.png" alt="Hello" width={300} height={150} />
        <p className="pt-4 px-4">Units will use common cover or ground to regain superiority.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center flex-1">
        <h1 className="pb-4">Alternate Bounding</h1>
        <Image  src="/bounding-alternate.png" alt="Hello" width={300} height={150} />
        <p className="pt-4 px-4">Units will use security to push past those holding cover to gain ground faster.</p>
    </div>
