# Masked Movement

Fireteam formations, for the purpose of our group, have interchangeable positions for congruent weapon platforms, and typically involve a spacing of ~10 meters. This distance can increase or decrease depending on present factors.

<FormationsGallery />

<Callout type="info">
    - The spacing between fireteam members is not a hard rule, and can be adjusted based on the environment and situation.
    - When an autorifleman is present, they will be placed on the strong side of Wedge Formations.
    - Staggered Columns may face inwards instead of outwards to effectively cover alleyways, large interior LDAs, etc.

## Pointman Concept [#pointman-concept-secman]

The pointman in the context of section maneuvers/movement in the open moves ahead of the group (refer to column graphic above), the rest of the group keeps one vacant reactionary space between them and the pointman. The pointman will use the space to retreat from danger. The team leader will focus on navigation. Either the pointman notices the danger, or alerts the team by his demise.

<Callout type="warning">
  - Avoid having the team leader as pointmain as they are the most important
  person in the team. 
  - The pointman is not a scout, and should not be used as
  such. The pointman is a reactionary position, and should not be used to scout
  ahead of the group.
