# Fireteam Formations

Fireteam formations, for the purpose of our group, have interchangeable positions for congruent weapon platforms, and typically involve a spacing of ~10 meters. This distance can increase or decrease depending on present factors.

-When an autorifleman is present, they will be placed on the strong side of Wedge / Echelon formations.
-Staggered Columns may face inwards instead of outwards to effectively cover alleyways, large interior LDAs, etc.
