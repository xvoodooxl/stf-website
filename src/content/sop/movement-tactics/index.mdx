# Movement and Tactics Overview

Movement and tactics are the foundation of survival and effectiveness in any operational environment. Whether operating individually or as part of a team, understanding how to move deliberately and tactically is critical to mission success.  
This section provides the baseline concepts that guide how we approach all movement and maneuver, regardless of the specific game or scenario.

## Importance of Movement Discipline

Movement is more than just getting from one place to another. It directly affects survivability, effectiveness in combat, and the team's ability to maintain cohesion. Undisciplined movement can compromise a mission before the enemy is even engaged.  
Discipline in movement includes maintaining proper spacing, using cover and concealment effectively, and moving with a clear purpose.

## Adapting Movement to the Mission Environment

The environment dictates how we move. Open fields, dense forests, urban areas, and mountainous regions each require different approaches to movement. Players must be able to recognize the environment they are operating in and adapt their movement techniques accordingly to maximize stealth, protection, and control.

Key factors to consider:

- Terrain type (urban, forest, desert, jungle)
- Visibility conditions (day/night, weather)
- Presence and type of enemy forces
- Objective type (reconnaissance, assault, defense)

## Threat Awareness and Situational Adaptation

Tactical movement demands constant threat awareness. Players should maintain a mental map of possible enemy locations, threats from different directions, and safe fallback routes.  
Adapting to changing threats — such as unexpected contact or loss of visibility — is essential to maintaining initiative and minimizing risk.

Threat awareness includes:

- Continually scanning the environment
- Listening for enemy movement or gunfire
- Anticipating likely ambush points
- Adjusting speed and formation based on threat level

## General Expectations for All Players

Regardless of rank or role, all players are expected to:

- Move with purpose and discipline
- Maintain communication and situational awareness
- Use available cover and concealment to minimize exposure
- Coordinate with teammates, especially during movements across open areas or when contact is likely
- React immediately and intelligently to enemy contact
- Prioritize the safety and success of the team over individual action

Mastering movement and tactics at both the individual and section levels creates a stronger, faster, and more capable force — one that can adapt to any challenge the battlefield presents.
