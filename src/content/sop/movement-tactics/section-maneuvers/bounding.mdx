# Bounding

## Purpose

Bounding is a technique used to move in a chosen direction without compromising security.  
It is performed by having one or more elements hold security over a hostile area while another element rushes to a further point of hard cover.  
Once set, the responsibilities switch, and the initially stationary unit then advances.  
Bounding enables sections and fireteams to move safely while maintaining the ability to suppress or engage enemies.

## Definition

- **Bounding**: A tactical movement method where one element moves while another provides covering fire or overwatch.

Bounding allows a section to advance, reposition, or cross open terrain without exposing the entire unit at once.

## Key Principles

- Only one element moves at a time; the other must always provide security.
- Cover and concealment should be used at every bound.
- Communication between moving and covering elements is critical.
- Movement should be quick, deliberate, and synchronized.

## Application

### Types of Bounding

Bounding can be conducted using two primary techniques:

<div className='flex w-full flex-row flex-wrap pt-4'>
  <div className='flex flex-1 flex-col items-center justify-center'>
    <h1 className='pb-4'>Succesive Bounding</h1>
    <Image src='/bounding-succesive.png' alt='Hello' width={300} height={150} />
    <p className='px-4 pt-4'>
      Units move forward to a new cover position while remaining roughly on the
      same line. Successive bounds maintain tighter cohesion and are used when
      caution is more important than speed.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div className='flex flex-1 flex-col items-center justify-center'>
    <h1 className='pb-4'>Alternate Bounding</h1>
    <Image src='/bounding-alternate.png' alt='Hello' width={300} height={150} />
    <p className='px-4 pt-4'>
      Units move forward past the stationary element, leapfrogging to gain
      ground faster. Alternate bounding is faster but can stretch the unit if
      not carefully coordinated.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

- **Successive Bounding**:

  - Units move forward to cover but stay aligned.
  - Used when caution, mutual support, and tight spacing are critical.

- **Alternate Bounding**:
  - Moving units leap past the covering units to advance faster.
  - Used when speed and aggression are necessary.

### Basic Bounding Sequence

**1. Covering Element Establishes Position**

- One element establishes security with good fields of fire.

**2. Moving Element Initiates Movement**

- Upon signal, the moving element advances toward the next piece of cover or concealment.

**3. Communication**

- The moving element communicates once set (e.g., "Set!") to inform the covering element.

**4. Role Switch**

- Covering element becomes the moving element and bounds forward.

### Bounding Formations

- **Fireteam Wedge**:

  - Best for flexibility and security during bounds.

- **File Formation**:
  - Used in restrictive terrain such as urban areas or forests.

### Bounding Overwatch

- Used when imminent enemy contact is expected.
- One element provides deliberate overwatch while the other moves carefully and deliberately.
- Focus is on deliberate control and immediate response to enemy engagement.

## Common Mistakes

- Both elements moving simultaneously, exposing the entire unit.
- Failing to communicate clearly when set or moving.
- Choosing poor cover or halting in the open.
- Losing visual or firing support between bounding elements.
- Moving without scanning after each bound.

## Practice and Drills

- **Alternate Bounding Drill**: Practice leapfrogging bounds across open terrain.
- **Successive Bounding Drill**: Practice moving as a line using successive bounding.
- **Bounding Overwatch Drill**: Advance toward objectives using bounding with active overwatch.

## Quick Reference Table

| Bounding Type       | When to Use                 | Key Points                     |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| Successive Bounding | Cautious, cohesive movement | Move in line, maintain spacing |
| Alternate Bounding  | Faster, aggressive movement | Leapfrog past covering element |
| Bounding Overwatch  | High threat expected        | Move slow, overwatch actively  |

## Summary

Bounding is a core team movement technique that balances mobility with protection.  
By alternating movement and overwatch between elements, a section can maintain pressure, momentum, and survivability under combat conditions.  
Clear communication, discipline, and good cover usage are essential to effective bounding operations.
