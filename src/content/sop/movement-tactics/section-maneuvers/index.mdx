# Section Movement and Tactics (SMT) Overview

Section Movement and Tactics (SMT) focuses on the coordinated movement and combat effectiveness of fireteams and sections.  
Unlike individual movement, SMT emphasizes teamwork, communication, and synchronized actions to achieve tactical superiority on the battlefield.

Successful section movement maximizes firepower, ensures flexibility under threat, and enables the unit to maneuver safely and aggressively in diverse environments.

## Core Concepts of SMT

SMT is structured around key areas of team-level movement and tactical execution:

- **Bounding**  
  The controlled movement of a section using alternating or successive groups. One element provides security and overwatch while the other moves.

- **Peeling**  
  A tactical withdrawal or lateral movement technique performed under fire. Teams move in a controlled, staggered sequence while maintaining suppression on the enemy.

- **Masked Movement**  
  Using terrain, structures, and natural features to move unseen by enemy forces. Often coordinated with suppression and deception techniques.

- **Fireteam Formations**  
  Organized arrangements of players (wedge, column, line, file, staggered column) that optimize movement, security, and response to threats based on terrain and mission.

- **Dispersion and Spacing**  
  Maintaining safe distances between players to minimize the impact of enemy explosives, automatic fire, and area attacks. Proper dispersion increases survivability without losing cohesion.

- **Reaction to Contact (Section Level)**  
  Immediate and deliberate actions taken when the section encounters enemy fire. Includes gaining fire superiority, moving to cover, coordinating return fire, and maneuvering to flank or break contact.

- **Suppressing Fire**  
  Delivering sustained and effective fire to disrupt enemy observation, aiming, and maneuver, allowing friendly elements to move safely.

- **Fire and Maneuver**  
  The principle of one element providing suppression while another element advances or repositions. Core to offensive movement under enemy contact.

- **Section Communication and Control**  
  Techniques leaders use to command the section effectively: voice commands, radio communication, and hand signals. Maintaining team cohesion, speed of action, and clarity during operations.

- **Terrain-Based Movement Planning**  
  Assessing the environment to select covered and concealed routes of movement, using terrain features for maximum protection and tactical advantage.

## Expectations for Fireteam and Section Members

All players operating as part of a fireteam or section are expected to:

- Maintain proper formation and spacing during movement.
- Communicate clearly and promptly with teammates and leaders.
- Provide effective suppression when required.
- Move only when coordinated with the team.
- React immediately and appropriately to enemy contact.
- Follow section leader instructions and adapt to changing threats and terrain.

Mastering Section Movement and Tactics allows the group to operate as a single, cohesive force, overwhelming threats through superior movement, communication, and firepower.
