# Post-Contact Procedures

Once hostile contact has ceased or diminished to a manageable state, your unit must transition from combat operations to assessment and recovery. Post-contact procedures ensure situational awareness is re-established, casualties are handled, and the element is ready for follow-on tasks or extraction.

---

## 1. 360° Security

Immediately after contact, your element must establish **360-degree security**. This involves:

- Re-orienting fireteams to cover all cardinal directions.
- Repositioning to defensible ground if current location is unsuitable.
- Maintaining spacing and avoiding bunching.
- Using fireteam formations as needed.  
  📘 [See: Fireteam Formations](/sop/section-maneuvers/fireteam-formations)

360 security is the foundation that enables all follow-on actions. Without it, your team remains vulnerable to a secondary attack or flanking maneuver.

## 2. ACE Report

Once secure, each fireteam or section lead will issue an **ACE Report** to their immediate superior. ACE stands for **Ammunition**, **Casualties**, and **Equipment**. Statuses are given using the SPECTRE traffic-light system:

- 🟢 Green – Fully effective.
- 🟡 Yellow – Still effective.
- 🔴 Red – May not be effective.
- ⚫ Black – Combat ineffective.

Example:

> `"Alpha, Bravo. Bravo is Yellow. One man down, ammo low. Holding with AT, over."`

## 3. SITREP

A **SITREP** (Situation Report) communicates the unit’s position, current status, and next intention. It is sent **after the ACE** if the unit lead is still capable.

SITREPs typically include:

- Who is reporting
- Who they are with (element strength)
- Current location
- What is happening
- Next action
- Requests (e.g., medevac, resupply)

Example:

> `"Bravo, Actual. Bravo is 3 strong, 100m south of intersection. Engaged light contact, pushing east to clear adjacent compound. Request eyes on our east flank, over."`

## 4. Forming Ad-Hoc Elements

In the event of casualties or fragmentation, it may be necessary to **form ad-hoc teams**. These are temporary elements formed from surviving members of different squads or fireteams to restore operational capability and secure the objective.

**General Guidelines:**

- Appoint a temporary lead for the element.
- Establish who has radios, AT, medkits, or key equipment.
- Prioritize grouping by proximity, capability, and mutual familiarity.
- Use this method to reach frontlines after respawning or regrouping.

## 5. Active Waiting

Sometimes, the best course of action is no action—at least for the moment. **Active waiting** is the practice of holding your position during a lull in contact while remaining alert, purposeful, and tactically aware.

> _"We're not doing nothing. We're doing **nothing… on purpose**."_

### Why Active Waiting Matters

Combat often unfolds in waves. Gunfights are rarely continuous—they ebb and flow. Enemies may reposition, flank, or make mistakes in the lull. Acting too quickly may expose your team to unnecessary risk.

Instead of rushing forward, **deny the enemy the opportunity** to catch your team mid-move or disorganized.

### What Active Waiting Looks Like

- **Maintain cover and spacing** – Stay low, stay spread.
- **Observe likely enemy approaches** – Watch lanes, windows, treelines.
- **Listen and scan** – Use all senses to detect enemy movement.
- **Resupply and reload** – Top off magazines, check gear.
- **Confirm orders** – Clarify intent from leadership.
- **Mentally rehearse next steps** – Prepare to act decisively if needed.

### Common Mistake

> _“The fight got quiet, so we pushed.”_

Avoid assuming a lull is the end of contact. Enemies may be lying in wait. Stay disciplined—**let the enemy make the first mistake**.

---

## Final Notes

Post-contact success depends on your ability to **stabilize, communicate, and reorganize**. These procedures are not optional—they form the critical bridge between surviving one engagement and succeeding in the next.

> “Win the fight. Win the aftermath.”
