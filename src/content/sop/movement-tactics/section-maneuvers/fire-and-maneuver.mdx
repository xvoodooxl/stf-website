# Fire and Maneuver

## Purpose

Fire and Maneuver is the heart of small-unit tactics.  
It involves one element providing suppressive fire to fix the enemy in place, while another element maneuvers to a position of advantage to defeat or bypass them.  
This tactic allows sections to maintain initiative, control the engagement, and overwhelm enemy forces through coordinated aggression.

## Definition

- **Fire and Maneuver**: A coordinated tactic where one element suppresses an enemy while another element moves under cover of that suppression to attack, flank, or reposition.

Fire and Maneuver is also commonly referred to as **Hammer and Anvil**:

- One team acts as the **hammer** (the moving assault force).
- One team acts as the **anvil** (the suppressing, fixing force).

## Key Principles

- Suppression must be effective before movement is attempted.
- Communication between moving and suppressing elements must be clear and constant.
- Movement must be decisive and aggressive to exploit enemy weakness.
- Roles (fire and maneuver) must be well-understood and properly executed without hesitation.

## Application

### The Four Fâ€™s of Fire and Maneuver

1. **Find**

   - Locate the enemy through observation, reconnaissance, or engagement.
   - Communicate enemy position clearly to the section.

2. **Fix**

   - Pin the enemy down using effective, credible suppressive fire.
   - Prevent the enemy from moving or firing accurately.

3. **Flank**

   - Use a second element to move to the enemy's side or rear while they are fixed.
   - Movement should be concealed or covered by suppression.

4. **Finish**
   - Eliminate the enemy through assault, flanking fire, or overwhelming firepower.

### Fire and Maneuver Sequence

1. **Establish Suppression**

   - Suppressing element initiates effective fire to fix enemy forces.

2. **Prepare to Move**

   - Maneuver element coordinates with suppressing element.
   - Confirm suppression is effective before moving ("Suppressed!" callout if applicable).

3. **Execute Movement**

   - Moving element advances using cover and concealment where possible.
   - Use bounding if necessary to close the distance.

4. **Role Switch if Needed**

   - After successful movement or flanking, suppressing and maneuver elements can switch as needed to continue pressure or reposition.

5. **Finish the Enemy**

   - Once in a superior position, use overwhelming fire to eliminate the enemy, or assault directly if necessary.

### Fire and Maneuver Patterns

- **Leapfrogging Bounds**:
  - Moving in short, quick sprints between cover, alternating suppression.
- **Hook Flanking Maneuver**:

  - Sweeping around wide to the enemyâ€™s flank or rear.

- **Center Peel (for Disengagement)**:
  - Breaking contact by peeling backward while maintaining fire.

## Communication Examples

- "Alpha, suppress enemy bunker! Bravo moving left!"
- "Bravo moving!"
- "Bravo set! Alpha move!"
- Hand signals used when noise discipline is required.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Attempting movement before enemy is effectively suppressed.
- Suppressing element failing to maintain pressure during movement.
- Poorly timed or miscommunicated moves leading to exposure.
- Moving without a clear goal or endpoint (exposing to unknown threats).

## Summary

Fire and Maneuver enables sections to dominate engagements through aggressive, coordinated action.  
By following the Four Fâ€™s â€” Find, Fix, Flank, Finish â€” teams can fix enemy forces, gain positional advantage, and decisively defeat them.  
Mastery of this principle ensures tactical superiority on the battlefield and maximizes the survivability of friendly forces.
