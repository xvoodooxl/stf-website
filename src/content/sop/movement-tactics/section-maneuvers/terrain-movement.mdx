# Terrain-Based Movement Planning

This article covers how to use terrain features to move safely, stay concealed, and maintain tactical flexibility. It also introduces the Tactical Holdâ€”a critical tool that allows a section to pause mid-movement, establish security, and give leaders time to reassess or issue new orders without unnecessary exposure.

## Key Principles

- **Use terrain to your advantage**: Prefer routes that provide hard cover or concealment to reduce risk.
- **Avoid exposing the section**: Stay off skylines, roads, and open fields when stealth or security is a priority.
- **Always plan with bounds**: Break long movements into short bounds between natural cover or dead ground.
- **Visual scanning is key**: Read the terrain ahead to anticipate obstacles, danger zones, or flanking opportunities.
- **Embed Tactical Holds into movement**: Pausing with purpose is better than pushing into unknown or risky terrain.

### Tactical Hold

A **Tactical Hold** is a planned or reactive halt ordered by the Section Lead or 2IC. Upon hearing the hold command, all members:

- Immediately stop movement and drop to a low profile.
- Spread out and establish **360Â° security**, covering all approaches.
- Maintain **strict noise and light discipline** unless otherwise instructed.
- Wait in position while leadership reassesses the route, checks maps, listens to comms, or prepares new orders.

Tactical Holds are used:

- When terrain or threat conditions ahead are uncertain.
- To prepare for a complex bound or crossing.
- After contact, to reset the teamâ€™s posture before re-engaging or withdrawing.
- During navigation checks, lost comms, or when the section is spread too thin.

Tactical Holds are not breaksâ€”they are an active security posture that buys leaders time without compromising the team.

## Terrain Examples

### Good Terrain to Use

| Terrain Feature   | Tactical Benefit                                  |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| Tree Lines        | Conceal movement, break silhouette                |
| Gullies / Ditches | Low-profile routes with cover from fire           |
| Walls / Buildings | Hard cover and protection in urban areas          |
| Terrain Folds     | Natural dead ground; invisible to distant enemies |
| Vegetation        | Concealment for stealth and observation           |
| Elevation Changes | Observation points, but risk of silhouetting      |

### Poor Terrain to Avoid

| Terrain Type       | Why to Avoid                                       |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| High Ground Ridges | Risk of silhouetting when crossing sky-lined areas |
| Open Fields        | Long lines of sight expose you to enemy fire       |
| Flat Roads         | Predictable travel lanes, prone to ambush          |
| Chokepoints        | Bridges, gates, and narrow paths are easy to trap  |

## Application

- **Route Selection**:

  - Choose a path that minimizes exposure by following tree lines, ditches, or terrain folds.
  - Avoid straight lines, predictable roads, and open ground unless absolutely necessary.

- **Bound Planning**:

  - Identify intermediate positions with cover to serve as breakpoints.
  - Each bound should end at a defensible terrain feature where the team can hold if needed.

- **Execution**:

  - Move by bounds or overwatch depending on terrain and threat.
  - If visibility or control is lost, the lead calls a **Tactical Hold**.
  - While halted, maintain 360Â° security and use terrain features for cover.

- **Leadership Use**:
  - Tactical Holds are ideal moments for issuing new orders, managing fatigue, confirming bearings, or waiting for external assets (e.g., supporting fire or other elements).

## Common Mistakes

- Moving across open terrain without scanning for safer options.
- Failing to rehearse or brief alternate routes before stepping off.
- Using roads or hilltops without considering silhouetting or ambush risk.
- Calling holds without enforcing proper dispersion or security posture.
- Treating Tactical Holds like rest stops instead of active security pauses.

## Summary

Terrain-based movement keeps your section protected, unpredictable, and in control. Adding Tactical Holds to your playbook allows leaders to make informed decisions mid-movement without rushing into danger. Used together, terrain and timing turn every movement into a tactical advantage.
