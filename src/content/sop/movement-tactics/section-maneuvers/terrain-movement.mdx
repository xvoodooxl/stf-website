# Terrain-Based Movement Planning

## Purpose

Terrain-based movement planning enables sections to move safely, efficiently, and tactically by using the environment to their advantage.  
By understanding how terrain impacts visibility, protection, and maneuverability, teams can reduce risk and avoid unnecessary exposure to enemy fire.

## Definition

- **Terrain-Based Movement Planning**: The process of selecting routes and positions based on terrain features that provide cover, concealment, and tactical options while moving toward an objective.

## Key Principles

- **Cover first**: Prefer routes that offer solid protection from fire.
- **Concealment second**: When cover isn't available, prioritize concealment to reduce detection.
- **Avoid obvious paths**: Roads, ridgelines, and open fields can silhouette or expose the section.
- **Plan bounds**: Identify intermediate cover positions for breaks and bounding.
- **Observe terrain at a distance**: Scan ahead to find usable micro-terrain and obstacles.

## Terrain Features to Use

| Terrain Feature   | Tactical Benefit                                  |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| Tree Lines        | Conceal movement, break silhouette                |
| Gullies / Ditches | Low-profile routes with cover from fire           |
| Walls / Buildings | Hard cover and protection in urban areas          |
| Terrain Folds     | Natural dead ground; invisible to distant enemies |
| Vegetation        | Concealment for stealth and observation           |
| Elevation Changes | Observation points, but risk of silhouetting      |

## Poor Terrain to Avoid

- **High Ground Ridges**: Silhouetting risk when crossing sky-lined ridges.
- **Open Fields**: Long lines of sight expose you to snipers or vehicles.
- **Flat Roads**: Obvious travel lanes that attract attention and fire.
- **Chokepoints**: Bridges, gates, and narrow trails can be easily ambushed.

## Route Planning Workflow

1. **Identify the Objective**

   - Where does the section need to go?

2. **Scan for Terrain Obstacles and Threats**

   - Look for open areas, ridges, dead ground, and known danger zones.

3. **Choose Primary Route**

   - Prefer cover-heavy or concealed paths.

4. **Select Backup or Flank Route**

   - Always plan an alternate in case of contact or blocked paths.

5. **Mark Bound Points**

   - Identify natural or artificial cover positions along the route for short sprints or pauses.

6. **Brief the Plan**
   - Section Leader communicates route, movement style, and contingency plans.

## In-Mission Adjustments

- If the route is compromised:

  - Use smoke or suppressive fire to redirect movement.
  - Shift to pre-planned backup route or reverse movement.

- Encourage individual terrain use:
  - Operators should independently move through micro-cover while maintaining formation spacing.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Moving straight across open areas without route planning.
- Following roads or obvious terrain lines when stealth is needed.
- Ignoring available dead ground or vegetation.
- Failing to plan alternate routes or react when movement is blocked.

---

## Practice and Drills

- **Map Brief Drill**: Before movement, practice quick terrain route planning and team brief.
- **Terrain Navigation Drill**: Navigate between two points using only terrain for concealment.
- **Flank Planning Drill**: Choose and rehearse primary + alternate flank paths based on terrain map.

## Quick Reference Table

| Terrain Type    | Best Use                          | Avoid If                           |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Tree Lines      | Concealment and flank movement    | Lined with enemies or open base    |
| Gullies/Ditches | Concealed movement and approach   | Waterlogged or funnel-like terrain |
| Open Fields     | Short sprints or with smoke cover | Uncovered, flat daylight crossing  |
| Ridges/Hilltops | Observation only (not movement)   | Crossed in silhouette              |
| Roads/Paths     | Speed during exfiltration only    | Obvious or linear threat zones     |

## Summary

Terrain is one of the most powerful tactical tools available.  
By planning movement based on cover, concealment, and observation lines, leaders and operators can minimize exposure, outmaneuver threats, and increase the teamâ€™s survivability.  
Smart terrain use transforms a predictable march into a tactically superior approach.
