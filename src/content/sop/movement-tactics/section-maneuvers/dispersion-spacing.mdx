# Dispersion and Spacing

## Purpose

Dispersion and spacing are essential for survivability and combat effectiveness in a tactical environment.  
Proper spacing prevents multiple operatives from being hit by a single explosive or burst of fire and allows for effective fields of fire, maneuvering, and situational awareness.

## Definition

- **Dispersion**: The overall spread of the section or fireteam across terrain.
- **Spacing**: The distance between individual operators within a formation.

These two principles reduce vulnerability, prevent bottlenecks, and help maintain tactical flexibility.

## Key Principles

- **Too close** = vulnerability to explosives, frag grenades, and suppressive fire.
- **Too far** = loss of mutual support, communication, and formation integrity.
- Spacing must **adapt** to terrain, visibility, and threat level.
- **Every player is responsible** for maintaining correct spacing — not just the leader.

## Standard Spacing Guidelines

| Terrain Type         | Suggested Spacing         | Notes                                        |
| :------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| Open Terrain         | 7–10 meters               | Maximize dispersion to avoid grouped hits    |
| Urban / Dense Cover  | 3–5 meters                | Maintain line of sight, reduce clutter       |
| Close Quarters (CQB) | 1–2 meters                | Tight spacing to maintain momentum and comms |
| Danger Area Crossing | 5+ meters between sprints | Avoid massing in open areas                  |

## Practical Application

### During Movement

- Each operator is responsible for adjusting their spacing based on the person in front.
- Always maintain **line of sight** with at least one teammate unless terrain prevents it.
- Avoid “tailgating” — especially when navigating corners or climbing obstacles.

### While Holding Position

- When stopping or holding:
  - Recheck spacing immediately.
  - Avoid clustering at cover (e.g., multiple players on the same tree or wall).

### When Engaging

- Spread out to allow for wide firing arcs.
- Avoid funneling or crowding into the same field of fire.
- Ensure spacing allows for flanking or support without friendly fire risk.

## Consequences of Poor Spacing

- **Fratricide**: Multiple operatives hit by a single grenade, explosive, or burst.
- **Line-of-fire Obstruction**: Blocking friendly arcs due to tight formations.
- **Loss of Control**: Overcrowding leads to confusion, miscommunication, and uncoordinated movement.
- **Panic Movement**: Tight groups often break under fire more chaotically than dispersed ones.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Bunching up at corners, breach points, or cover.
- Not adjusting spacing after changing terrain types.
- Tailgating during sprints or CQB movement.
- Pausing in open ground too close to other teammates.

---

## Practice and Drills

- **Spacing Drill (Open Terrain)**: Move through open ground maintaining correct interval.
- **Urban Movement Drill**: Navigate narrow environments while preserving spacing.
- **Stop-and-Hold Drill**: Practice breaking from movement and setting a defensible, dispersed hold automatically.

## Quick Reference Table

| Action Type     | Ideal Spacing     | Purpose                          |
| :-------------- | :---------------- | :------------------------------- |
| Movement (Open) | 7–10 meters       | Avoid area-effect weapons        |
| Urban Movement  | 3–5 meters        | Line of sight without congestion |
| CQB Stack       | 1–2 meters        | Speed through tight interiors    |
| Hold Position   | 3–5 meters (min.) | Avoid grouped vulnerability      |

## Summary

Maintaining proper dispersion and spacing is a foundational habit that keeps teams alive and effective.  
By adjusting for terrain, maintaining visual and firing lanes, and preventing clustering, players can reduce unnecessary casualties and ensure room for maneuver and tactical execution — even under fire.
