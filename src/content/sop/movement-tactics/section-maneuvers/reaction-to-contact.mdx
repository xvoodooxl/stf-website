# Reaction to Contact (Section Level)

## Purpose

When a section comes under unexpected enemy fire or encounters an enemy force, a fast and coordinated reaction is critical to avoid being overrun, disorganized, or pinned.  
This article outlines the immediate steps a team must take to react cohesively, gain fire superiority, and either maneuver or break contact as needed.

## Definition

- **Reaction to Contact (Section Level)**: The coordinated actions a fireteam or full section takes immediately after encountering enemy forces, including returning fire, moving to cover, communicating threat information, and preparing for further action (maneuver or withdrawal).

## What is a Contact?

A **contact** is the confirmed presence of enemy forces.

### Types of Contact

- **Soft Contact**:  
  Enemy forces have been observed but are unaware of your presence.

- **Hard Contact**:  
  Enemy forces are actively engaging you, or have detected and are hunting your team.

## Key Principles

- Quickly determine if the contact is soft or hard.
- Always prioritize gaining and maintaining **fire superiority** during hard contact.
- Move immediately to **cover and concealment**.
- Communicate clearly and concisely using the **aDDD** format.
- Maintain control through decisive action and leadership.

## Application

### Reaction to Soft Contact

- Find and move into cover if available.  
  If no cover exists, immediately lower your profile by going prone or crouching.
- Observe and monitor the enemy discreetly.
- Report contact to the Team Leader using aDDD (Alert, Direction, Distance, Description).
- Await orders; do not open fire unless specifically instructed.

### Reaction to Hard Contact

If fired upon or detected, the team immediately follows the **RCR** procedure:

- **R â€“ Return Fire**:  
  All available members immediately return fire toward the enemyâ€™s direction to suppress.

- **C â€“ Cover**:  
  Move quickly to the nearest cover.  
  If none is available, go prone or crouch to reduce profile while returning fire.

- **R â€“ Return Accurate Fire**:  
  From cover, transition to controlled, deliberate shots to fix or pin the enemy down.

### Full Section Reaction Sequence

1. **Return Fire (Suppress)**  
   Immediate, aggressive fire to break enemy momentum.

2. **Seek Cover**  
   Move individually or in small groups to nearby cover points.

3. **Communicate and Identify**  
   Use aDDD format to report enemy direction, distance, and type.  
   Example: "Contact! North! 100 meters! Squad near buildings!"

4. **Establish Base of Fire**  
   One fireteam provides continuous suppression while the other prepares to maneuver.

5. **Maneuver or Break Contact**

   - If the situation permits: Execute a flanking movement.
   - If maneuver is not feasible: Break contact using **Peeling** techniques.

### Variations Based on Situation

- **Close-Range Ambush**:

  - Immediate aggressive fire and movement out of the kill zone.

- **Long-Range Contact**:
  - Set a base of fire, establish dominance at range, maneuver methodically.

## Common Mistakes

- Hesitating when distinguishing between soft and hard contact.
- Freezing under fire or failing to return fire aggressively.
- Bunching up during movement to cover.
- Poor communication, causing confusion in the section.
- Maneuvering without establishing a base of fire.

## Summary

Reaction to Contact at the section level relies on quickly identifying the type of contact and responding decisively.  
Whether encountering soft or hard contact, disciplined action â€” through suppression, movement to cover, communication, and coordinated maneuvering â€” ensures the team maintains the initiative and minimizes casualties.
