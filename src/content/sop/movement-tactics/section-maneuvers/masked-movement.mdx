# Masked Movement (Section Level)

## Purpose

Masked Movement at the section level focuses on minimizing the visibility and detectability of an entire fireteam or squad while moving across the battlefield.  
By using natural and artificial concealment, maintaining disciplined movement, and adapting formations to terrain, sections can maneuver effectively without alerting enemy forces.

## Definition

- **Masked Movement (Section Level)**: The coordinated movement of multiple players using terrain, formations, posture, and timing to obscure their presence from enemy observation and targeting.

Masked movement protects the entire unit from early detection, ambush, or unwanted engagement.

## Key Principles

- Maximize use of terrain features (trees, buildings, hills, depressions) for concealment.
- Select formations that support stealth while maintaining security.
- Control movement speed and exposure based on enemy threat level.
- Use smoke or environmental effects when natural concealment is not available.
- Maintain proper spacing and movement discipline to avoid drawing attention.

## Application

### Route Planning

- Prioritize paths that provide consistent concealment:
  - Woodlines, hedgerows, walls, trenches, riverbeds, folds in the ground.
- Avoid silhouetting the team against ridgelines, roads, or skylines.
- Plan fallback points and alternate routes if compromised.

### Movement Discipline

- Use formations that match terrain:

  - **Wedge** in open, semi-concealed areas.
  - **Column** or **staggered column** in narrow, dense areas.
  - **Diamond** formation for 360Â° security in open ground.

- Adjust posture as needed:

  - **Crouched or prone movement** when crossing particularly exposed ground.
  - **Standing movement** only when speed outweighs stealth.

- Minimize communication noise:

  - Use hand signals when possible.
  - Keep radio transmissions short and essential.

- Move in controlled bounds or steady, deliberate paces depending on threat level:
  - If imminent enemy contact is expected, use **bounding overwatch** under concealment.

### Use of Smoke

- Deploy smoke grenades to obscure movement when necessary:
  - To cross open ground without natural concealment.
  - To retreat if compromised during movement.
- Smoke placement should screen the enemy's view, not the team's own line of movement.

### Point Man and Front Security

- The point element leads the formation but does not stray too far ahead.
- Maintain one reactionary space between the point and the main element.
- The lead should move cautiously and signal back if threats or obstacles are detected.

## Common Mistakes

- Moving through open areas without using concealment.
- Silhouetting entire formations on ridgelines or open horizons.
- Bunching up or creating obvious patterns easily spotted by the enemy.
- Failing to adjust posture based on exposure level.
- Over-reliance on smoke instead of proper route selection.

## Summary

Masked Movement at the section level enables entire teams to maneuver across hostile terrain without exposing themselves unnecessarily to enemy observation and fire.  
By mastering terrain use, posture management, disciplined formations, and controlled movement, sections retain the element of surprise and maintain tactical initiative.
