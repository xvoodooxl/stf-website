# Suppressing Fire

## Purpose

Suppressing fire is a critical technique that uses sustained, aggressive fire to fix or incapacitate enemy forces.  
By forcing the enemy to take cover, suppressing fire enables friendly forces to maneuver safely, disengage, or dominate the engagement.

## Definition

- **Suppressing Fire**: The use of deliberate, repeated gunfire to disrupt enemy movement, observation, and ability to return effective fire.  
  It does not necessarily require hitting enemy forces, but must be credible and threatening enough to keep them pinned down.

**Key Quote**:

> _“Moving without fire is suicide and fire without movement is a waste of ammunition.”_

## Key Principles

- Suppression is not random firing; it is controlled aggression aimed to dominate the enemy’s ability to fight.
- Suppression buys time and opportunity for maneuver.
- Ammunition discipline must be maintained; suppression cannot be sustained indefinitely.
- Coordination between suppressing elements increases effectiveness and minimizes weapon overheating.

## Application

### Suppressing Fire Techniques

- **Automatic Weapons (Machine Guns/Autorifles)**:
  - Deliver short, aggressive bursts ("Die Motherfucker, Die" rhythm).
  - Fire for a brief period (~1–2 seconds) then pause (~1 second) before repeating.
  - Focus bursts into likely enemy positions, adjusting as necessary.

- **Multiple Weapons: Talking Guns**:
  - Two or more operators alternate their suppressive bursts.
  - When one operator is firing, the other is resting or reloading.
  - Minimal to no downtime between bursts maintains constant enemy suppression.
  - Clear verbal signals:
    - "Reloading!" (signaling temporary solo suppression)
    - "Up!" or "Green!" (signaling ready to resume alternating fire)

- **Standard Rifles**:
  - While less effective than autorifles, suppression can be achieved by:
    - Multiple riflemen firing controlled, deliberate shots into the same target area.
    - Focused, paced fire over an extended time.
    - Creating a persistent threat environment for the enemy.

### Ammunition Discipline

- Suppression should be continued until:

  - Approximately **one magazine** (rifles) or **one belt** (machine guns) is expended,
  - Unless otherwise directed by a team leader.

- Fire should be adjusted based on available ammunition, mission priorities, and enemy reaction.
- Wasteful suppression without tactical purpose drains combat power.

## Offensive and Defensive Use of Suppression

- **Offensive**:  
  Suppression enables maneuver toward the enemy, allowing assault teams to close distance safely.

- **Defensive**:  
  Suppression delays or disrupts enemy advances, enabling friendly forces to retreat, reposition, or call reinforcements.

## Fire Control Techniques

- **Lift Fire**: Trick the enemy into staying in cover by aiming high over their position without directly hitting it. Used to allow assaulting teams to close distance with reduced risk of friendly fire. Called only at the last possible moment — do not give the enemy a chance to resurface.

- **Shift Fire**: Redirect suppressive fire from one area to another as the assault progresses or the enemy relocates. Commonly used when flanking forces are nearing the original suppressive fire zone, or when new threats are identified. Must be clearly communicated to avoid gaps or friendly fire.

## Common Mistakes

- Continuous full-auto firing leading to ammunition depletion or overheating.
- Suppressing without aiming near enemy positions (ineffective threat).
- Poor coordination between multiple weapons (both reloading at once).
- Over-suppressing without transitioning to movement or maneuvers.
- Forgetting verbal coordination ("Reloading!" / "Up!") during talking guns.

## Practice and Drills

- **Talking Guns Drill**: Practice alternating fire between two operators while maintaining constant suppression.
- **Timed Suppression Drill**: Sustain effective suppression for 30–60 seconds using standard rifles without burning full magazines.
- **Covering Maneuver Drill**: One team suppresses while another maneuvers, alternating roles.

| Technique             | Best Use                               | Key Points                                     |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| Autorifle Suppression | Fast, aggressive suppression           | Short bursts, brief pauses                     |
| Talking Guns          | Team suppression with minimal downtime | Alternate fire, call reloads                   |
| Rifle Suppression     | Supplement autorifles or act in mass   | Paced, focused fire on known/suspected targets |

## Summary

Suppressing fire is a vital tool for achieving tactical dominance.  
By maintaining credible, aggressive pressure on the enemy, friendly forces create opportunities to maneuver, escape danger, or decisively win engagements.  
Effective suppression demands discipline, teamwork, and constant situational awareness — not simply "spraying" rounds without purpose.
