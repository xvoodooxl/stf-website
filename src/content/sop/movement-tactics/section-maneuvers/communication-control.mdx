# Communication and Control

## Purpose

Effective communication and control are essential for coordinating movement, executing tactics, and maintaining cohesion in a section.  
A well-led section can operate smoothly, react quickly, and dominate the battlefield â€” while poor communication often leads to confusion, friendly fire, or mission failure.

This article covers how section leaders maintain control through voice communication, radio discipline, and role-based delegation.

## Definition

- **Section Communication and Control**: The systems, procedures, and leadership techniques used to direct and manage a section during movement, engagement, and maneuver operations.

## Key Principles

- **Clarity**: Keep messages short, specific, and repeatable.
- **Timing**: Communicate before movement, contact, or changes in plan â€” not during action.
- **Discipline**: Avoid excessive chatter; prioritize operational calls.
- **Delegation**: Team leaders should not micromanage individual movement â€” assign fireteam responsibilities and trust the structure.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Section Leader (SL)**:

  - Directs overall movement and tactical decisions.
  - Communicates over radio (long-range or squad net).
  - Delegates tasks to team leaders and monitors the section status.

- **Team Leaders (TL)**:

  - Control their individual fireteam (usually 2â€“3 operators).
  - Relay section leader orders to their team.
  - Manage spacing, facing, and local execution.

- **Individual Operators**:
  - Maintain situational awareness and formation.
  - Report contact using aDDD (Alert, Direction, Distance, Description).
  - Respond quickly to movement or combat orders.

## Communication Types

### 1. Local Voice (Proximity)

- Used for direct, close-range communication within a fireteam.
- Best for fast coordination while moving or in contact.
- Example: "On me", "Stack left", "Cover that door"

### 2. Radio Communication

- Used for section-level and cross-team coordination.
- Requires clear call signs and minimal interference.
- Example: "Bravo, move up to my position", "Contact north, 100m, 3-man patrol!"

## Communication Formats

### Contact Reports (aDDD)

- **Alert**: "Contact!"
- **Direction**: "North!"
- **Distance**: "100 meters!"
- **Description**: "Enemy fireteam, rooftop!"

### Movement Orders

- "Alpha hold, Bravo push left"
- "On my go â€” bounding forward!"
- "Bravo, suppress; Alpha, maneuver on flank"

### Status Reports

- "Green" â€“ Ready
- "Yellow" â€“ Low ammo or minor injury
- "Red" â€“ Combat ineffective
- "Set" â€“ In position and ready
- "Moving" â€“ Actively changing position

## Optional: Hand Signals (Contextual Use)

> While most supported games do not allow for true hand signals, you may use **verbal shorthand** or **preset in-game gestures** (if available) for:

- Silent peels
- Visual attention direction
- Pointing during stealth movements

These should be agreed upon before missions and are not required in SOP.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Talking over critical callouts (contact, move, flank).
- Unclear or ambiguous movement instructions ("Move up" â€” to where?).
- Failing to confirm orders received ("Copy", "Set", etc.).
- Overloading radio channels with unnecessary updates.
- Section leader micromanaging individual movement instead of using team leaders.

---

## Practice and Drills

- **Comms Drill (Fireteam)**: Practice short, clear local voice calls during formation changes or contacts.
- **Radio Discipline Drill**: Simulated mission with enforced radio brevity (5-second rule per call).
- **Chain of Command Drill**: Section leader issues objective, TLs execute independently, operators report up.

## Quick Reference Table

| Communication Type | Purpose                         | Format Examples                        |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------- |
| Contact Report     | Enemy detection                 | "Contact, East, 100m, Two-man patrol!" |
| Movement Orders    | Section maneuver                | "Alpha hold, Bravo flank left"         |
| Status Reports     | Team readiness updates          | "Green", "Red", "Set", "Moving"        |
| Proximity Voice    | Immediate local action          | "On me", "Cover that corner"           |
| Radio Comm         | Inter-team/section coordination | "Bravo push up, Alpha suppress"        |

## Summary

Strong communication and control are the backbone of every successful section.  
By maintaining discipline, using clear terminology, and respecting the chain of command, leaders ensure that their teams move, fight, and survive as a single cohesive unit.  
While games may vary in communication tools, mastering voice and radio usage is universally critical for tactical success.
