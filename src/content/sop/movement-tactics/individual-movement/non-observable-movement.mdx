# Masked Movement

## Purpose

Masked Movement focuses on minimizing your chances of being detected by enemy forces while moving across the battlefield.  
By moving intelligently and blending into the environment, players can achieve tactical surprise, bypass enemy positions, and control engagements on their terms.

## Definition

- **Masked Movement**: Movement techniques and behaviors designed to avoid detection by enemy forces through visual, audio, and movement discipline.

The goal is to move from one location to another without being seen, heard, or otherwise detected.

## Key Principles

- Use terrain and vegetation to break up your silhouette and obscure your movement.
- Control movement speed and posture based on the threat level and environment.
- Move during moments of distraction or when visibility is limited (e.g., during gunfire, smoke, night).
- Always plan your route to maximize concealment and minimize exposure.

## Application

### Movement Posture and Speed

- **Standing**: Fastest movement, highest profile. Use only when speed outweighs stealth.
- **Crouched**: Reduced profile, moderate movement speed. Use when partial concealment is available.
- **Prone**: Lowest profile, slowest speed. Use when maximum stealth is needed.

Adjust posture dynamically based on:

- Terrain
- Distance to enemy positions
- Availability of concealment or cover
- Mission urgency

### Route Planning

- Choose routes that provide natural concealment (vegetation, rocks, terrain dips).
- Avoid telegraphing yourself against ridgelines, roads, or open ground by silhouetting (see Telegraphing section for detailed techniques).
- Prefer shadowed areas, dense foliage, and uneven ground for movement.
- Plan fallback cover points in case you are compromised during movement.

### Timing and Distraction

- Move when the enemy is distracted (during gunfire, explosions, environmental noise).
- Time movement with environmental changes (wind gusts, shifts in light).
- Avoid predictable movement patterns (e.g., always sprinting after every shot).

### Group Movement Considerations

- Maintain proper spacing to avoid being spotted as a group.
- Use slow, deliberate movements when operating close to enemy positions.
- Leaders should designate movement phases: "Prepare to move," "Move," and "Hold."

## Common Mistakes

- Moving too quickly or loudly through exposed areas.
- Failing to adjust posture when moving closer to the enemy.
- Telegraphing your position by skylining against clear backdrops like hills or open sky.
- Following predictable paths that the enemy can anticipate.
- Moving without observing or planning safe fallback options.

## Practice and Drills

- Conduct stealth patrols through mixed terrain focusing on silent, low-profile movement.
- Practice posture transitions (standing > crouched > prone) under time pressure.
- Set up observation points and attempt to move unseen by other team members acting as sentries.
- Practice route selection exercises, planning paths that maximize concealment.

## Quick Reference Table

| Movement Posture | Visibility | Speed    | Best Use                        |
| :--------------- | :--------- | :------- | :------------------------------ |
| Standing         | High       | Fast     | When speed is prioritized       |
| Crouched         | Medium     | Moderate | Moving with partial concealment |
| Prone            | Low        | Slow     | Maximum stealth near threats    |

## Summary

Mastering Masked Movement is key to maintaining the element of surprise and avoiding unnecessary engagements.  
By combining posture control, terrain use, route planning, and movement timing, players can operate effectively without revealing their position â€” gaining the upper hand in any tactical scenario.
