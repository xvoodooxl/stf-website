# Masked Movement

**Masked Movement** is the practice of using terrain, foliage, buildings, or artificial concealment (like smoke) to move without being observed or directly targeted. This technique helps teams approach objectives, reposition under threat, or withdraw from contact without exposing themselves to enemy fire.

> _“If they can’t see you, they can’t shoot you. If they can’t track you, they can’t flank you.”_

## Principles of Masked Movement

- Stay out of sight — use defilade, concealment, and timing to avoid detection
- Always move with a plan — from one covered/concealed point to another
- Avoid silhouetting — never crest a hill or ridge unless absolutely necessary
- Use teammates to watch sectors and cover movement

## Application

### Movement Posture and Speed

- **Standing**: Fastest movement, highest profile. Use only when speed outweighs stealth.
- **Crouched**: Reduced profile, moderate movement speed. Use when partial concealment is available.
- **Prone**: Lowest profile, slowest speed. Use when maximum stealth is needed.

Adjust posture dynamically based on:

- Terrain
- Distance to enemy positions
- Availability of concealment or cover
- Mission urgency

### Route Planning

- Choose routes that provide natural concealment (vegetation, rocks, terrain dips).
- Avoid telegraphing yourself against ridgelines, roads, or open ground by silhouetting (see Telegraphing section for detailed techniques).
- Prefer shadowed areas, dense foliage, and uneven ground for movement.
- Plan fallback cover points in case you are compromised during movement.

### Timing and Distraction

- Move when the enemy is distracted (during gunfire, explosions, environmental noise).
- Time movement with environmental changes (wind gusts, shifts in light).
- Avoid predictable movement patterns (e.g., always sprinting after every shot).

### Group Movement Considerations

- Maintain proper spacing to avoid being spotted as a group.
- Use slow, deliberate movements when operating close to enemy positions.
- Leaders should designate movement phases: "Prepare to move," "Move," and "Hold."

## Common Mistakes

- Moving on the ridgeline instead of sligthly below it on the military crest.
- Moving too quickly or loudly through exposed areas.
- Failing to adjust posture when moving closer to the enemy.
- Telegraphing your position by skylining against clear backdrops like hills or open sky.
- Following predictable paths that the enemy can anticipate.
- Moving without observing or planning safe fallback options.

## Quick Reference

| Situation                      | Masking Technique                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Crossing a field               | Use smoke or terrain folds                     |
| Flanking a building            | Stay along walls, avoid windows                |
| Repositioning under enemy eyes | Short bounds + concealment + low posture       |
| Night movement                 | Use shadows, reduce silhouette, minimize noise |
| Breaking contact               | Terrain masking + smoke + spread spacing       |

Masked movement allows your team to control visibility, set tempo, and survive longer in contested spaces. Use it often — and wisely.
