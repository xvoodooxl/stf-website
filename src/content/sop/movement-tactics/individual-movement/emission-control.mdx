# Emission Control (EMCON)

## Purpose

Emission Control (EMCON) is the practice of minimizing detectable signals — such as light, noise, movement, and radio chatter — that could reveal your position to the enemy.  
Effective EMCON improves stealth, preserves tactical surprise, and enhances the survivability of individuals and teams in all environments.

## Definition

- **Emission Control (EMCON)**: The discipline of reducing or managing all forms of detectable emissions to avoid enemy detection.

Emissions include:

- **Visual emissions** (visible lights, lasers, muzzle flashes)
- **Infrared emissions** (IR lasers, IR lights)
- **Audio emissions** (weapon noise, footfalls, radio chatter)
- **Movement signatures** (shifting foliage, dust, silhouetting)

## Key Principles

- Only emit what is absolutely necessary to achieve the mission.
- Understand that even invisible emissions (like infrared) can compromise you against a properly equipped enemy.
- All forms of noise — including footsteps, equipment clatter, and weapon manipulation — can reveal your presence.
- Control communications: unnecessary or excessive radio use can expose your location and intentions.

## Application

### Visual Emission Control

- **Visible Lights and Lasers**:

  - Use visible weapon lights and lasers only when absolutely necessary.
  - Prefer momentary or pressure switch activation: light only when needed, not continuously.
  - Avoid pointing visible lasers at friendly forces or into open areas unnecessarily.

- **Infrared Lights and Lasers**:

  - Treat IR lights with the same caution as visible lights.
  - Use IR lasers sparingly and intentionally:
    - To designate a point of interest when necessary.
    - To track a target only when awaiting engagement authorization.
  - Remember: enemies with night vision or IR detection will see your IR emissions clearly.

- **Muzzle Flash Management**:
  - Prefer firing from covered, concealed, or shaded positions.
  - Short controlled bursts help reduce sustained flash and noise exposure.

### Audio Emission Control

- Move quietly: control your pace to avoid loud footsteps, especially on hard surfaces or debris.
- Use whisper-level communications when close to threats.
- Minimize weapon manipulation noises (reloading, charging) near enemies unless necessary.

### Movement Signature Management

- Avoid silhouetting yourself against the skyline or open backdrops.
- Minimize debris disturbance when moving through dry or cluttered environments.
- Coordinate movements to avoid excessive rustling or sudden noise bursts.

### Radio and Communication Discipline

- Keep radio transmissions brief, clear, and mission-essential.
- Avoid "open mic" or idle chatter that can clutter comms and draw attention.
- Use pre-established brevity codes and hand signals where possible.

## Common Mistakes

- Leaving lights or lasers on unnecessarily during movement or engagements.
- Assuming IR devices are "invisible" and using them recklessly.
- Speaking loudly or broadcasting on the radio without tactical necessity.
- Making excessive noise when moving through vegetation or urban areas.
- Failing to recognize how movement can betray position even without direct sound or light.

## Practice and Drills

- Conduct patrols in low-light environments focusing on silent movement and light/laser discipline.
- Practice using pressure-switch activated lights for quick, temporary illumination.
  {/* - Train team members to communicate silently using hand signals and pre-planned gestures. */}
- Run drills emphasizing short, clear radio communications under stress.

## Quick Reference Table

| Emission Type | Common Sources                  | Control Method                                  |
| :------------ | :------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Visual        | Lights, lasers, muzzle flashes  | Use momentary activation; fire from concealment |
| Infrared      | IR lights and lasers            | Use intentionally; minimize exposure            |
| Audio         | Movement, gear, radio chatter   | Move quietly, secure gear, use radio discipline |
| Movement      | Silhouettes, debris, vegetation | Use covered/concealed routes; move deliberately |

## Summary

Effective Emission Control (EMCON) is crucial for operating undetected and maintaining tactical advantage.  
By minimizing visual, infrared, audio, and movement emissions, players can approach objectives silently, avoid ambushes, and increase mission success rates.  
Every operator must take personal responsibility for controlling their signature to ensure the survival and effectiveness of the team.
