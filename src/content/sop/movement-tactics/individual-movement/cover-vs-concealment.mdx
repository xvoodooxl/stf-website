# Cover and Concealment

## Purpose

Understanding and correctly using cover and concealment greatly increases your survivability and effectiveness during engagements.  
Proper use of available protection allows you to minimize your exposure to enemy fire, avoid detection, and control the battlefield.

## Definition

- **Cover**: Any object, structure, or terrain feature that provides physical protection from enemy fire and explosions. Cover should be capable of absorbing or deflecting incoming rounds, protecting you from both direct hits and shrapnel.
- **Concealment**: Anything that hides you from enemy observation but does not provide ballistic protection. Concealment limits an enemy's ability to see or target you but offers no actual defense against gunfire.

## Key Principles

- Not all cover is equal; some materials (like wood or drywall) may not reliably stop bullets.
- Concealment can prevent detection but will not stop incoming rounds.
- Good cover allows you to observe, fire, and move while minimizing your exposure.
- Always plan your next cover point before moving.
- Smoke can be used to create temporary concealment when no natural concealment is available.

## Application

### Using Cover

- Identify and move between solid, reliable cover such as walls, engine blocks, thick trees, dirt berms, or sandbag fortifications.
- Prioritize cover that provides protection from multiple threat directions whenever possible.
- When fighting from cover, expose only the minimum necessary body parts to observe or fire. Use the "peek and shoot" method when appropriate.
- Maintain a low and stable firing position to reduce exposure and increase stability.

### Using Concealment

- Move through areas that obscure enemy line of sight, such as tall grass, bushes, trees, or shadows.
- Use concealment for silent approaches, flanking maneuvers, or repositioning without drawing attention.
- Remember: concealment delays detection but offers no protection if discovered. Always be ready to transition quickly to hard cover if engaged.
- Pay attention to how lighting, movement, and environment can either enhance or compromise your concealment.

### Using Smoke

- Deploy smoke grenades to obscure enemy vision during movement, retreats, or assaults.
- If enemy positions are known, throw smoke toward them to block their sightlines and disrupt their ability to aim.
- If enemy positions are unknown, deploy smoke near your own location to confuse enemy forces and provide cover for movement.
- When the enemy uses smoke, apply suppressive fire into the concealed areas to limit their ability to maneuver or reposition safely.

> **Note:** Smoke when used incorrectly can expose your position to the enemy. Use it wisely and in coordination with your team.

## Common Mistakes

- Using smoke when not necessary, which can and will expose your position to the enemy.
- Treating concealment as if it were effective cover.
- Staying stationary behind weak or temporary cover.
- Moving without first identifying the next piece of cover.
- Failing to use smoke when natural concealment is unavailable.
- Overexposing body parts while fighting from cover.

| Term            | Definition              | Examples                              | Best Use                                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Cover**       | Physical protection     | Walls, sandbags, vehicle engine block | Fighting position, shield during firefights    |
| **Concealment** | Visual obstruction only | Bushes, smoke, shadows                | Movement, ambush setup                         |
| **Smoke**       | Artificial concealment  | Smoke grenade clouds                  | Movement across danger zones, retreat, marking |

## Summary

Mastering cover and concealment is essential for all tactical operations.  
By understanding the difference between physical protection and visual obstruction, and using them intelligently, players can survive longer, maneuver more effectively, and maintain the initiative against enemy forces.
