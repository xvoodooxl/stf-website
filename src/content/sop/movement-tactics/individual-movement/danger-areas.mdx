# Danger Areas

## Purpose

Crossing Danger Areas teaches players how to safely navigate exposed terrain such as open fields, roads, or river crossings where cover and concealment are limited.  
Proper crossing techniques minimize exposure time, maximize survivability, and maintain team momentum.

## Definition

- **Danger Area**: Any open space or terrain feature that exposes players to potential enemy observation and fire without sufficient immediate cover or concealment.

Examples of danger areas:

- Open fields
- Roads and highways
- Bridges and river crossings
- Wide riverbeds or open dry terrain

## Key Principles

- Avoid crossing danger areas unless absolutely necessary.
- Cross danger areas quickly, decisively, and with minimal exposure.
- Use natural or artificial concealment whenever available.
- Coordinate crossing with teammates using bounding or overwatch techniques.

## Application

### Approaching a Danger Area

- Halt before reaching the danger area.
- Observe and scan for enemy presence or movement.
- Identify cover or concealment points across or within the area.
- Plan the crossing: who moves first, direction, and pace.

### Crossing Techniques

- **Individual Sprint Crossing**:

  - Move quickly across the danger area using a sprint.
  - Do not stop in the middle of the open ground.
  - Pick a visible landmark (tree, building, berm) as a movement goal.

- **Bounding Movement**:

  - If operating with teammates, one element moves while the other provides overwatch.
  - First element sprints across, establishes security on the far side.
  - Second element then bounds across when signaled.

- **Use of Smoke**:
  - Deploy smoke grenades to obscure enemy observation when natural concealment is unavailable.
  - Smoke can be thrown forward to block enemy vision or dropped at your position depending on the situation.

### Key Behavior While Crossing

- Move aggressively without hesitation.
- Use unpredictable movement (zig-zag or irregular paths) if under enemy observation.
- Minimize time spent exposed â€” crossing should be fast and committed.
- Maintain weapon readiness while moving; scanning briefly as you sprint.

### After Crossing

- Immediately seek cover and establish security.
- Turn back to cover teammates who are still crossing if in a team setting.
- Maintain observation for enemy counter-actions.

## Common Mistakes

- Crossing danger areas without first observing or planning.
- Stopping in the middle of open ground due to indecision.
- Bunching up with other players while crossing (easy target for enemy fire).
- Moving too slowly or hesitantly.
- Failing to use smoke when no concealment exists.

## Practice and Drills

- **Sprint Crossing Drills**: Practice moving rapidly from cover to cover across open areas under timed conditions.
- **Bounding Danger Area Drills**: In teams, practice bounding movement with one element providing overwatch while the other crosses.
- **Smoke Usage Drills**: Practice deploying smoke to cover movement across simulated danger areas.

## Quick Reference Table

| Technique                  | Best Use                            | Key Points                           |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Individual Sprint Crossing | Short, narrow danger areas          | Quick sprint, direct to cover        |
| Bounding Movement          | Wider danger areas or team movement | Covering fire and coordinated bounds |
| Smoke Deployment           | No natural concealment available    | Mask movement, confuse enemy         |

## Summary

Crossing danger areas requires speed, coordination, and careful planning.  
By assessing the risk, planning routes, using sprint or bounding techniques, and employing smoke when necessary, players can minimize their exposure and successfully move through even the most hazardous terrain without unnecessary casualties.
