# Individual Movement and Tactics (IMT)

Individual Movement and Tactics (IMT) covers the essential skills and concepts each player must master to move effectively, survive under threat, and contribute to the team's success.  
This section focuses on principles that apply across all games and environments, forming the foundation of all tactical movement.

Effective individual movement minimizes risk, maximizes the use of available terrain, and ensures that players can observe and react to threats in a controlled and deliberate manner.

## Core Concepts of IMT

IMT is structured around key phases of skill development:

### Phase 1: Core Foundations

- **Cover and Concealment**  
  Understanding the difference between cover (protection from fire) and concealment (protection from observation), and using them appropriately during movement and engagements.

- **Masked Movement**  
  Moving deliberately and stealthily to minimize the chances of being seen, utilizing terrain, timing, posture, and natural concealment.

- **Emission Control (EMCON)**  
  Managing and minimizing emissions — including noise, light, movement, and radio communication — to avoid detection by enemy forces.

- **[Telegraphing](/sop/movement-tactics/individual-movement/telegraphing)**  
  Avoiding actions that unintentionally reveal your presence, such as silhouetting (skylining), gear exposure, and accidental light or laser use.

### Phase 2: Immediate Tactical Response

- **Reaction to Contact (Individual)**  
  Reacting instinctively when under fire using the RCR principle: Return Fire, Cover, Return Accurate Fire, followed by communicating using the aDDD method.

- **Movement Techniques (Individual)**  
  Practicing tactical movement methods — including posture transitions and short sprinting — to reposition effectively under varying threat conditions.

### Phase 3: Situational Awareness and Decision-Making

- **Observation Techniques (Scanning and Sectors)**  
  Maintaining constant awareness of surroundings through disciplined scanning techniques, sector assignments, and threat anticipation.

- **Crossing Danger Areas**  
  Identifying and safely crossing exposed areas like roads, open fields, or riverbeds quickly and deliberately, using sprinting, bounding, and smoke when needed.

## Expectations for Individual Players

Every player is responsible for:

- Moving intelligently and purposefully at all times.
- Maintaining low visibility and minimizing their detection signature.
- Reacting decisively and appropriately to unexpected threats.
- Using cover and concealment effectively.
- Communicating clearly and efficiently with teammates during movement and contact.
- Maintaining situational awareness and supporting the team’s overall security.

Mastering Individual Movement and Tactics ensures that each player can operate independently when needed and enhances the strength, cohesion, and survivability of the section as a whole.
