# Reaction to Contact (Individual)

## Purpose

Reaction to Contact (Individual) covers the immediate actions a player must take when suddenly coming under enemy fire.  
Reacting quickly and correctly increases survival chances, helps regain the initiative, and sets the foundation for the team’s counterattack or withdrawal.

## Definition

- **Reaction to Contact (Individual)**: The immediate sequence of actions taken by a player to survive, communicate, and counter threats when unexpectedly engaged by the enemy.

The primary goals are captured in the acronym **RCR**:

- **Return Fire**: Immediately fire toward the threat to disrupt enemy aim.
- **Cover**: Move quickly to the nearest cover to protect yourself.
- **Return Accurate Fire**: From a covered position, deliver controlled and effective fire at the enemy.

## Key Principles

- Speed and decisiveness save lives: hesitation under fire kills.
- Returning immediate fire breaks enemy momentum.
- Finding cover protects you from sustained or accurate enemy fire.
- Accuracy and controlled fire under cover disrupt and defeat threats.
- Communication allows the rest of the team to react correctly.

## Application

### Basic Reaction Sequence (RCR)

**1. Return Fire**

- Immediately fire toward the source of enemy contact.
- If exact location is unknown, fire toward the likely threat area to disrupt enemy actions.
- Volume of fire matters in the first moments; precision can follow once stabilized.

**2. Cover**

- Move quickly and instinctively to the nearest available cover.
- Use unpredictable movements (zig-zag, sprint) if moving under observation.
- If no hard cover is available, move to concealment to break line of sight.

**3. Return Accurate Fire**

- Once behind cover, shift to deliberate, aimed fire.
- Suppress the enemy and target visible threats effectively.
- Maintain a low profile and expose only minimally while engaging.

**4. Communicate (aDDD)**

- Use the abbreviated aDDD method to report the contact:
  - **a - Alert**: Notify teammates that contact has been made (e.g., "Contact!").
  - **D - Direction**: Call out the direction of the threat (e.g., "East!").
  - **D - Distance**: Estimate the distance to the threat (e.g., "40 meters!").
  - **D - Description**: Briefly describe the threat (e.g., "Two-man patrol!").
- Example communication: **"Contact, East, 40 meters, two-man patrol!"**

**5. Prepare for Follow-Up Action**

- Be ready to move, flank, suppress, or assist the fireteam based on team leader commands.
- Maintain situational awareness; threat locations and battlefield dynamics can change rapidly.

### Special Considerations

- **When Exposed**: If caught in the open, prioritize aggressive movement toward cover without freezing.
- **Suppression Priority**: Even inaccurate immediate fire can disrupt the enemy's aim and coordination.
- **Observation**: After reaching cover, carefully observe to locate the threat before exposing yourself.

## Common Mistakes

- Failing to return immediate fire, giving the enemy uncontested initiative.
- Moving to cover without suppressing the enemy first.
- Returning inaccurate fire without moving to solid protection.
- Shouting overly long or unclear reports under stress.
- Overexposing while trying to spot the enemy.
- Moving predictably under fire (straight-line sprinting).

## Practice and Drills

- **RCR Drill**: Practice immediate return fire, sprint to cover, then deliver aimed shots.
- **Cover Prioritization Drill**: Navigate terrain while identifying and moving to cover after simulated contact.
- **Stress Communication Drill**: Under simulated stress, practice quick and clear aDDD contact reports.

| Step                     | Action                                  | Notes                                |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| 1. Return Fire           | Fire toward the threat                  | Disrupt enemy aim and momentum       |
| 2. Move to Cover         | Sprint to nearest hard cover            | Prioritize survival over return fire |
| 3. Return Accurate Fire  | Controlled, aimed shots                 | Suppress and defeat enemy threats    |
| 4. Communicate (aDDD)    | Alert, Direction, Distance, Description | Keep it short and clear              |
| 5. Prepare for Follow-Up | Maneuver, support team actions          | Stay flexible based on the situation |

## Summary

An immediate, decisive reaction to enemy contact following the **RCR** principle — Return Fire, Cover, Return Accurate Fire — prevents casualties, regains control of the engagement, and enables the team to counterattack or break contact.  
Using the **aDDD** communication method ensures teammates are informed quickly and accurately, improving the team's overall effectiveness under fire.
