# Observation Techniques (Scanning and Sectors)

## Purpose

Observation Techniques are critical for maintaining situational awareness during movement and stationary operations.  
Effective scanning prevents surprise contact, enables early threat detection, and ensures that all areas around the team are covered without gaps or confusion.

## Definition

- **Observation Techniques**: The disciplined, methodical practice of monitoring the environment using scanning patterns and sector responsibilities to detect threats early and maintain situational control.

## Key Principles

- Observation must be continuous but deliberate — random or panicked scanning is ineffective.
- Divide observation responsibilities by assigning sectors to individual players.
- Scan in layers: near ground, mid-distance, and far horizon.
- Avoid unnecessary exposure while scanning from cover or concealment.

## Application

### Scanning Techniques

- **Near to Far**:

  - Begin by scanning close terrain (where immediate threats can emerge).
  - Progress to mid-range terrain features (buildings, treelines, roads).
  - Finish with long-distance scanning along the horizon.

- **Left to Right (or Right to Left)**:

  - Sweep methodically across your assigned sector.
  - Avoid "whipping" your view back and forth without purpose.

- **Layered Scanning**:
  - While moving or paused, mentally split your scan into vertical layers:
    - Ground level (tripwires, prone threats, hidden enemies).
    - Mid-level (standing threats, windows, doorways).
    - High level (rooftops, balconies, elevated terrain).

### Sector Responsibilities

- When operating as part of a team, assign observation sectors:
  - Each player covers a specific arc (example: left, front, right).
  - This prevents multiple players scanning the same area and leaving others uncovered.
- Maintain sector awareness even while moving:
  - Do not constantly look at teammates.
  - Trust each player to maintain their assigned responsibility.

### Scanning While Moving

- Walk with head on a swivel but controlled:
  - Constant but subtle head movement — no frantic swinging.
  - Quick glances into likely threat locations (alleys, bushes, windows).
- Slow your scan when moving through complex or high-threat areas.

### Observation from Cover

- Use cover intelligently to scan:
  - Pie corners gradually (small increments, not full body exposure).
  - Lean slightly or use angles without fully stepping out.
- Avoid "tunneling" — focusing only through a narrow view without checking surroundings.

## Common Mistakes

- Fixating on one spot and missing movement elsewhere.
- Overexposing while trying to get a better view.
- Scanning randomly without a consistent pattern.
- Breaking sector discipline and overlapping scans with teammates.
- Ignoring near ground threats while focusing too much on distant threats.

## Practice and Drills

- **Sector Scanning Drills**: Assign sectors to each player and run observation exercises, rewarding quick threat detection without breaking cover.
- **Near-Far Scanning Drill**: Practice near-to-far and left-to-right scanning while stationary and while moving.
- **Movement Observation Drill**: Navigate a route while maintaining scanning and calling out observed threats.

## Quick Reference Table

| Technique              | Purpose                             | Notes                         |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| Near to Far Scanning   | Detect threats at different ranges  | Start close, end far          |
| Sector Assignment      | Divide observation responsibility   | Prevent gaps and overlaps     |
| Scanning While Moving  | Maintain awareness while advancing  | Controlled, subtle movements  |
| Observation from Cover | Detect without unnecessary exposure | Use angles and gradual pieing |

## Summary

Maintaining constant, disciplined observation is critical to avoiding surprise engagements and maintaining tactical control.  
By using scanning patterns, assigning sectors, and practicing subtle, controlled observation, players can ensure that no threat goes unnoticed and that the team operates as a cohesive, aware unit.
