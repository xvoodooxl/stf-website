# Movement Techniques (Individual)

## Purpose

Movement Techniques (Individual) provide players with practical methods to move safely and tactically across the battlefield.  
Mastering these techniques allows players to minimize exposure, maintain flexibility, and support team operations effectively.

## Definition

- **Movement Techniques (Individual)**: The use of specific body postures, movement patterns, and tactical habits to move safely under varying levels of threat.

These techniques are the building blocks of tactical mobility, balancing speed, stealth, and protection based on the situation.

## Key Principles

- Choose your posture (standing, crouched, prone) based on terrain, concealment, and enemy presence.
- Short, deliberate movements are safer than long, exposed sprints.
- Always plan your next point of cover or concealment before moving.
- Move unpredictably when under threat to avoid becoming an easy target.

## Application

### Posture-Based Movement

- **Standing Movement**:

  - Fastest speed, highest profile.
  - Use when speed is critical, and enemy presence is unlikely or you have sufficient cover.

- **Crouched Movement**:

  - Moderate speed, medium profile.
  - Use when partial concealment is available, and you need to minimize visibility without sacrificing too much mobility.

- **Prone Movement**:
  - Slowest speed, lowest profile.
  - Use when maximum stealth is required, such as moving under direct enemy observation or across open, exposed terrain.

### Short Dashes (3–5 Second Rush Concept)

- Move from cover to cover using short, rapid sprints.
- Spend no more than 3–5 seconds exposed before reaching new cover or concealment.
- Mentally identify your next destination before initiating movement.
- Sprint aggressively, unpredictably, through an irregular path if under enemy fire.

### Bounding as an Individual

- Move in short bounds even when operating alone:
  - Move from one cover point to another while minimizing time spent exposed.
  - Each movement should be planned to reduce visibility and maximize survivability.

### Movement Techniques Based on Environment

- **Urban Terrain**:

  - Use walls, vehicles, and building edges for cover.
  - Minimize exposure at corners and intersections (slice the pie).

- **Woodland and Vegetation**:

  - Move slowly to reduce noise and visual signature.
  - Use tree trunks and bushes for cover and concealment.

- **Open Terrain**:
  - Favor prone or crouched movement if cover is scarce.
  - Use smoke if necessary to create temporary concealment during sprints.

## Common Mistakes

- Moving in straight lines when under observation.
- Sprinting across open terrain without planning or concealment.
- Standing unnecessarily when crouch or prone movement would be safer.
- Failing to identify the next cover point before moving.
- Hesitating and exposing yourself for too long during movement.

## Practice and Drills

- **Posture Transition Drills**: Rapidly transition between standing, crouched, and prone positions while maintaining weapon readiness.
- **Cover-to-Cover Sprint Drills**: Practice short dashes between simulated cover points, emphasizing speed and unpredictability.
- **Bounding Movement Drills**: Move across an open field using available terrain features as intermediate cover, stopping after every bound to reassess.
- **Environmental Movement Drills**: Train in different terrain types (urban, woodland, open ground) to adapt movement styles.

## Quick Reference Table

| Movement Type | Speed    | Profile | Best Use                                |
| :------------ | :------- | :------ | :-------------------------------------- |
| Standing      | Fast     | High    | Speed priority, minimal enemy threat    |
| Crouched      | Moderate | Medium  | Partial concealment, balanced movement  |
| Prone         | Slow     | Low     | Maximum stealth under enemy observation |

## Summary

Mastering individual movement techniques is essential for survival and operational success.  
By selecting the correct posture, planning your movement carefully, and using short, aggressive sprints, players can cross dangerous areas effectively while minimizing the chance of being targeted or detected.
