# Weapon Safety

Weapon safety is the cornerstone of all tactical behavior. It builds trust, prevents friendly fire, and ensures that every operator maintains control and professionalism in all situations — regardless of the game environment.

## General Principles

- **Never point your weapon at anything you do not intend to kill or destroy.**
- **Your weapon should never be pointed directly at friendly operators. Ever.**
- **Friendly fire is never acceptable, even in high-pressure situations.**

Good safety isn’t just about avoiding accidents — it’s about maintaining the integrity and capability of the team as a whole.

## Ready Positions: High vs. Low Ready

Proper muzzle discipline is achieved by using **high** or **low ready** stances, depending on context.

- **Low Ready** – Weapon compressed to the body and angled downward. Ideal for navigating tight spaces or operating near teammates.
- **High Ready** – Weapon angled up and off-line. Used for signaling readiness or during transitions. Use cautiously and intentionally.

  **Note:** High and Low Ready may not be available in all supported platforms.
  Use the closest equivalent available on the current platform being used.

## Earning Your Shot

Firing your weapon is **not automatic** — you must earn the right to take the shot.

Only fire when:

- You have **a clear line of fire** with no friendlies or civilians in danger.
- You are **positioned appropriately**, even if that requires maneuvering.
- You are confident your shot will not compromise your team’s safety.

  "Earning your shot" means taking full responsibility for what happens when
  that trigger is pulled.

## On-Line Firing

Operate **on-line** with your teammates when engaging:

- Side-by-side alignment with a shared field of fire
- Maintain a **1-meter reactionary gap** between operators
- Prevents crossfire, confusion, and spacing issues

If **on-line firing** is not possible, employ:

## Muzzle Before Flesh (MBF)

**MBF** is a close-quarters safety technique for tight spaces.

- Your **muzzle must extend past your teammate’s body** before firing
- Maintain **physical contact** between pointman and wingman
- Use **outward angles** to safely cover threats without risking teammates

> MBF ensures your shot clears friendly bodies before it clears the barrel.

## Emergency Safety Protocols

If a mistake occurs, own it immediately:

- **Negligent Discharge**:  
  `"ND! ND! —my fault, weapon safe now!"`

- **Bad Grenade Throw**:  
  `"Bad frag! Bad frag!"`  
  (All teammates take immediate cover.)

- **Other Explosive Misuse**:  
  `"Clear out!"` or other clear callouts

Follow with:

1. **ACE Report** if injuries occurred
2. **Immediate safety reset** to prevent recurrence

## Summary

Weapon safety is more than avoiding accidents — it’s a reflection of tactical maturity and team discipline. Maintain these principles, and you’ll protect not only your team but your reputation as a capable Warfighter.
