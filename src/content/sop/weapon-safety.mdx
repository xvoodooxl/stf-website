# Weapon Safety

Weapon safety is the cornerstone of all tactical behavior. It builds trust, prevents friendly fire, and ensures that every operator maintains control and professionalism in all situations—regardless of the game environment.

## General Principles

- **Never point your weapon at anything you do not intend to kill or destroy.**
- **Your weapon should never be pointed directly at friendly operators. Ever.**
- **Friendly fire is never acceptable, even in high-pressure situations.**

Good safety isn’t just about avoiding accidents—it’s about maintaining the integrity and capability of the team as a whole.

## Ready Positions: High vs Low Ready

Proper muzzle discipline is achieved by using **high** or **low ready** stances, depending on context.

- **Low Ready**: Keeps your weapon compressed to your body and angled downward. Ideal for navigating close quarters or when teammates are nearby.
- **High Ready**: Angles the weapon up and to the side. This is more situational and carries **nonverbal significance** (e.g. signaling readiness). Use with caution and clear intent.

> Use ready positions to avoid flagging friendlies. Control your muzzle before movement—not after.

## Earning Your Shot

Firing your weapon is **not automatic**—you must earn the right to take the shot.

You are only cleared to shoot if:

- You have **a clear line of fire** with no friendlies or civilians in the foreground or background.
- You are **positioned appropriately**, even if that means maneuvering for a better angle.
- You are confident your fire will not compromise the safety of your team.

> "Earning your shot" means taking full responsibility for what happens when that trigger is pulled.

## On-Line Firing

When operating as a team, always strive to be **on-line** with your teammates when engaging.

- **On-line** means you are side-by-side with a clear field of fire.
- Maintain at least a **1-meter reactionary gap** between operators.
- This gap allows freedom of movement, reduces confusion, and prevents crossfire.

If you **cannot get on-line**, then you must employ:

## Muzzle Before Flesh (MBF)

**MBF** is a close-quarters safety technique used when spacing isn’t possible.

- Your **muzzle must extend past your teammate’s body mass** before engaging.
- There should be **physical contact** between the pointman and wingman to coordinate movement.
- Use outward angles to safely engage without obstructing or endangering teammates.

> MBF ensures your shot clears friendly bodies before it clears the barrel.

## Emergency Safety Protocols

Even with discipline, mistakes can happen. If they do, **you must own it immediately**:

- **Negligent Discharge**:  
  `"Negligent discharge—my fault, weapon safe now!"`

- **Frag grenade thrown unintentionally or dangerously**:  
  `"Bad frag! Bad frag!"`  
  (Everyone should immediately take cover.)

- **Other explosive misuse**:  
  `"Misthrow! Clear out!"` or other specific callouts.

Follow up with:

1. **ACE Report** if injuries occurred.
2. **Immediate safety reset** to avoid further incidents.

## Summary

Weapon safety is more than avoiding accidents—it’s the expression of tactical maturity and team discipline. Adhere to these principles at all times, and you’ll not only protect your team—you’ll lead by example.
