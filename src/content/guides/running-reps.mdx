# Running REPS

**REPS ARE NOT TRAINING.**
They are fast-paced, focused exercises designed to build practical skills through repetition. The goal is to **practice, not lecture**. Keep things moving, focused, and engaging.

---

## Core Principles

- **Keep Theory to a Minimum:**
  Classroom or theoretical explanation should not exceed **5 minutes**. The battlefield is the classroom.

- **Have a Clear Focus:**
  Each REP should target a specific skill or concept (e.g., CQB Room Entries, Land Navigation, SMT Bounding).

- **Know Your METT-TC:**
  Understand the Mission, Enemy, Terrain, Troops, Time, and Civilians factors for each REP.
  _(Refer to the full **[METT-TC Breakdown](/sop/leadership/frameworks)** for details.)_

  - **Mission:** What is the purpose of this REP? What skill is being exercised?
  - **Enemy:** Define a realistic threat. What would they know? How would they act?
  - **Terrain:** Consider how the environment shapes the scenario. Does it support the skill being practiced?
  - **Troops:** What resources are available to participants? Are they working within realistic limitations?
  - **Time:** Ensure the allotted time for the REP is consistent with the mission objectives. Is there enough time to achieve the objective without dragging, and not so much that focus is lost?
  - **Civilians:** Are there any environmental or scenario constraints that should influence decision-making?

- **No Storytelling:**
  While REPS focus on practical skill execution rather than storytelling, a touch of immersion can help set the stage and engage participants. Add brief context if it supports the learning objective, but always keep the focus on action over narrative.

- **Validate Your Plan:**
  Ensure the REP is executable in the selected game platform. Test it beforehand if needed. Don’t wing it the night of—ask for help if uncertain! We have experienced members familiar with scenario design and execution—don’t hesitate to reach out for guidance or support.

## REP Structure

| Phase         | Duration | Purpose                                                            |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Prep**      | ≤ 10 min | Brief focus points, expectations, and known consequences.          |
| **Operation** | Varies   | Execute the scenario. Keep it moving—avoid downtime.               |
| **AAR**       | ≤ 10 min | Quick review. No long debates. GM highlights key learning moments. |
| **Repeat**    | N/A      | Run the next REP or iteration immediately.                         |

- Total REP Session Duration: **90 to 120 minutes (Preferably \~90 min)**

### **GM Briefing Guidelines**

The briefing sets the tone and expectations. Keep it focused, professional, and under 10 minutes. Cover the following:

1. **Objective of the REP:**

   - What skill or tactic are we practicing?
   - Why is it important?

2. **Scenario Context (Keep it Simple):**

   - Where are we operating (map/terrain overview)?
   - Who is the enemy and what are their capabilities?
   - What assets are available to participants (e.g., CAS, IDF, vehicles, UAVs)?

3. **Operational Constraints:**

   - Time limits for each REP.
   - Any special rules of engagement or limitations?

4. **Q\&A (1-2 minutes max):**

   - Quick clarifications only. Extended discussions should be avoided.

## After Action Review (AAR)

AARs should be **short, focused, and actionable**. This isn’t the time for long speeches or debates.

**Use the "What, So What, Now What" Format:**

- **What happened?**
  Briefly state key events or outcomes.
- **So what?**
  Why does it matter? What did we learn from it?
- **Now what?**
  What actions or adjustments should be made in the next REP?

**Best Practices:**

- Use screenshots or quick examples to highlight teaching points.
- Focus on behaviors and decisions, not personal criticism.
- Prioritize key moments that impacted mission success or failure.
- Keep it moving—if the point has been made, move on.

Refer to the full [Debriefing SOP](/sop/mission-planning/debriefing) for more structured guidance on conducting effective AARs.

## GM Tips

- **Think Like the Enemy:**
  When controlling OPFOR, behave as a real-world counterpart would.
  _Example: "What would a Russian squad leader do in this situation?"_

- **Be Fair and Reasonable:**
  OPFOR should not have perfect information. Play to the enemy’s level of knowledge, not your omniscient GM perspective.

- **Use Mistakes as Lessons, Not Punishments:**

  - Unintended mistakes? Turn them into teaching moments.
  - Take screenshots of mistakes and review them briefly during the AAR.
  - If there _are_ punishments or consequences, **make them known beforehand during the prep phase**.

- **Observe and Note:**
  As the GM, you have the best view of the battlefield. Take quick notes during each REP to address key learning points in the AAR.

## Final Reminders

- REPS are about **doing**, not discussing.
- Keep things short, sharp, and focused.
- Prepare properly, deliver decisively, and review quickly.
- Always ask yourself: _"What skill are we building right now?"_
